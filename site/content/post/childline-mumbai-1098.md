<p><b>A phone number that spells hope for millions of children across India, CHILDLINE is India&#8217;s first 24-hour, free, emergency phone service for children in need of aid and assistance.</b></p>
<p>CHILDLINE was founded by <b>Ms. Jeroo Billimoria</b>, who was then a professor at the Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS), Mumbai. Initiated in June 1996 as an experimental project of the department of Family and Child Welfare of TISS, the national toll-free number <strong>1098</strong> was inaugurated on <strong>20<sup>th</sup> of June 1996</strong>. CHILDLINE has come a long way today, to becoming a nationwide emergency helpline for children in distress.</p>
<p>The number is publicized as  <strong>dus-nau-aath (ten-nine-eight)</strong> instead of calling it one-zero-nine-eight.</p>
<p>Whether you are a concerned adult or a child, you can dial 1098, the toll free number to access the services. CHILDLINE not only responds to the emergency needs of children but also link them to services for their long-term care and rehabilitation. CHILDLINE has to date, reached out to over three million children across the nation through such calls.</p>
<p>CHILDLINE is a platform bringing together the Ministry for Women &amp; Child Development, Government of India, Department of Telecommunications, street and community youth, non-profit organisations, academic institutions, the corporate sector and concerned individuals.</p>
