<p>I have been fortunate enough to witness two spectacular suburbs, Chembur and Bandra over the decades. Situated right opposite on the east-west end of Mumbai, both have unveiled themselves to me and rather uniquely. </p>
<h4 id="7pd10">Believe it or not, I kept seeing the sign of &#x27;Chembur&#x27; behind cabs, auto rickshaws and ads as if the universe was leading me there. And little did I know that after 2.5 decades of life in Bandra, I would settle down in Chembur. </h4>
<p>Locations become a part our personality, we speak from experience, interaction and local exposure.  I have seen both Chembur and Bandra from close quarters. Here&#x27;s how different and similar they are as habitats. </p>
<h3 id="2q3dm">Similarities in Chembur and Bandra &#8211;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Both the diametrically opposite suburbs were once remote villages. Chembur comprises of several villages such as Mahul, Ghatla, Wadavli, Gavanpada. Derived from the Marathi word &#x27;Chimboree&#x27; aka Large Crab, Chembur quite literally holds its natives in its clutches of modernization and fast paced development.  The British shortened it to &#x27;Chembur&#x27; owing to linguistic limitations. </li>
<li>Bandra on the other hand is a coastal locale. It has history of fishermen aka Koli and the farmer populous occupying its villages such as Shirley, Chimbai, Pali and Khar among others.  The word &#x27;Bandra&#x27; originates from Persian/Urdu language which aptly means <em>port</em>.  The suburb was once under the Portuguese possession. They were instrumental in the promotion of Christianity and hence baptized several farmers and even encouraged the construction of Churches found till date.   </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="7ps2e">The sweet and lingering smell of fish that emanates from the Khar Danda area reminds one of Bandra&#x27;s roots. A handkerchief will come in handy. </h4>
<h3 id="bj0jm">Pro Tip #1 &#8211; To experience the best of Chembur, head to Chembur Camp. The place was once occupied by refugees during partition, and hence the name. Here you can indulge in sea food, meat and sweet specialties.  Vig for Dal Pakwaan and Pattice Chole,  Ranjeet Da Dhaba for lipsmacking finger food. Jhama for the best Dahi Wada and Gulab Jamun </h3>
<h3 id="9thn6">Pro Tip #2 &#8211; Similarly in Bandra, you can head to Punjab Sweet House for the perfect serving of sweet &amp; spicy Pani Puri along with hot samosa. Tharu for ghee based Sev ki Mithai and Elco to experience the best in fast-food. </h3>

The personality of posh changes to practical as you reach the other end.  People are quite warm and accepting. It is a great racial mix coexisting in harmony. </p>
