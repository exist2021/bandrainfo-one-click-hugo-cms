<p>[quote]What he wanted was so simple: bread, hearty and wholesome, with a firm slice and a good crust.[/quote]</p>
<p>As a young chef in Brussels, Alain could not find the right bread for his restaurant.</p>
<p>Passionate about quality, he returned to his roots and opened a small bakery where he could knead flour, salt and water into the rustic loaves of his childhood.</p>
<p>He called his bakery[quote] “Le Pain Quotidien.&#8221;[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s tricky. (It was so simple in Belgium!)</p>
<p>In English, the name means[quote] &#8220;The Daily Bread.&#8221;[/quote]</p>
<p>It sounds like this:<b> luh paN koh-ti-dyaN </b></p>
<p>Le Pain Quotidien bread is made today exactly as it was in the beginning: with organic flour, salt, and water, kneaded and shaped by hand and baked in a hearth under the watchful eye of artisan bakers.</p>
<p>Understanding the magic of a buttery, flaky croissant and of a dark, fudgy brownie, the delectable pastries in the patisserie are finely crafted. The pastries are baked fresh every day to offer that magic.</p>
<p>Friends and strangers alike come together around LPQ’s communal table to break bread and linger for a while. Like all of their furniture, the communal table is made from reclaimed wood, which means no trees were sacrificed for us to sit and unwind.</p>
<p>Unlike most commercial bakeries, Le Pain Quotidien uses no additives, preservatives, or improvers during our bread making process.</p>
<p>To create our signature breads, we use levain, a natural rising agent made from a sourdough starter, water and salt. Using levain rather than yeast produces breads with a rich aroma and sound structure.</p>
<p>Because we use a traditional process to create our breads, they may have a shorter shelf life than the commercial breads you&#8217;re accustomed to consuming.  This is because most commercial breads are made using additives and preservatives that extend the life of the loaf.</p>
<p>Be it for the bakery, breakfast, beverages, soup, tartines, salads, sharing platters, hot dishes, evening specials or desserts, we insist on the freshest and finest ingredients. If we can&#8217;t find them, we make them ourselves.</p>
<p>Our shelves are lined with the products we&#8217;ve created: the jams and chocolate spreads on the communal table, the granola in your parfait, the coffee that fills your bowl.</p>
<p>These items are available for purchase at the counter.</p>
<p>When at Le Pain Quotidien, take a seat next to a neighbor, share the Brunette and be reminded that, even in the big city, we are a community.</p>
