<p>Inspite of promoting themselves to be a health cafe, especially among vegans and the ones on a keto diet, the truth is that it’s also a favourite among non-vegetarians as well. The most popular food items are Skinny Pizza, Pesto Pasta, Mint Cooler, Pumpkin Soup and Salad. As for a health restaurant in Bandra, it is reasonably priced.</p>
<p>Simran Sharma, 21, an employee with Gandhi fellowship said, “Farmer’s Cafe is a very healthy treat. The food was freshly prepared and fulfilling. The vegetables were also organic. The desserts were my favourite!”</p>
<p>Daria, 25, a fitness trainer said, “I am quite impressed with the way they have put up the menu. It’s a right combination of both taste and health. The environment too is very warm and friendly. I would highly recommend all the health freaks out there to definitely try this one.”</p>
<p>Sarah Sharma, 16, a student from Chandigarh said, “Initially I wanted to come to this restaurant because I heard Katrina Kaif visited it. When I came, I was busy relishing the mango-chocolate pastry with my sister so much that I didn’t pay attention to my surroundings. If I come back to Mumbai I would definitely like to visit this place again and also recommend it to my friends back home.”</p>
