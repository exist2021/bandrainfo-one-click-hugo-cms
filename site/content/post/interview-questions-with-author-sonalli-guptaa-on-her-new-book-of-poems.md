<h3>Could you introduce yourself to our readers in your own words?</h3>
<p>I am born and brought up in Mumbai. I am a mother of 3, been versatile as a per- son, have varied interests and a multi-tasker.</p>
<h3>Your team Magica Asteria participated in the recently held Tony Premiere league. What was the aim of Magica Asteria in being part of such an sport event?</h3>
<p>Magika Asteria has been participating in various events across the city. It is such a pleasure to know that so much in Mumbai happens fo sports if only there was more visibility and better organisation. It&#8217;s been a great learning experience as a team owner and more than that as a person. immense growth and learning. I have also been now organising throw-ball events for women, and my aim is to empower women through sports.</p>
<p>I have received a very positive response for it, and I will look at all possibilities to do more for it.</p>

<h3>You are launching a book on poems which you have auto-written on Love Life and everything in between? Could you tell us what do you mean by auto-writing and what the book is all about?</h3>
<p>My book of poems called &#8220;of love&#8230;life and everything in between&#8221; is in print stage and all prepared to release by the end of this month. I have added aspects of my facilitation through questions and empowering people to look deeper into their lives.</p>
<p>The other thing I do is auto-writing, where people have queries about their lives and I am then a conduit between a higher msg and them. Receiving and giving as a medium, or rather a communicator. I can connect to beings from after-life and communicate with them as required.</p>
<h3>Could you tell us what are you favourite places in Mumbai? What aspect of the suburb you like the most and hate the most?</h3>
<p>I love my city. I have lived in suburbs all my life and studied and hung out in town, so I have had the best of both always. I love a lot of places and keep trying new ones. I love swanky restaurants and hotels and also the little quaint ones around the streets.</p>
<p>I love the warmth and most of all the Gulmohar trees all around in the suburbs especially Juhu where I grew up. I honestly hate the way all pavements have been encroached upon by everyone from building gates, to hawkers, to broken roads, bins, etc etc.</p>
<p>If one had to even consider keeping up with civic sense and use pavements to walk. It is practically impossible to do so without it being a roller coaster ride.</p>
