<ul>
<li>To care for the advanced and terminally ill Cancer patients and those cancer patients suffering from AIDs also.</li>
<li>To offer this care to all who need it, irrespective of community caste or creed.</li>
<li>To give preference to the poor and needy</li>
<li>To five this care totally free of cost.</li>
<li>To conduct research for palliation in advanced Cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main Branch in Mumbai, with the new extension can accomodate upto 100 inpatients, in five patient wards of 10 beds each and fifty patients in double-bedded rooms.</p>
<p>The Shanti Avedna Sadan is a service organization where absolutely no charges are levied. Hence, there are no private rooms in any of the Branches.</p>

<p>No specific treatment for the Cancer is given, as all this has already been exhausted before the patient is admitted. Besides, there are no infrastructure facilities for Cancer treatment, and hence it would be unfair to any patient who can still benefit from Cancer treatment, even for palliation, to be admitted in the Sadan.</p>
<p>Any patient who has advanced Cancer is entitled to this care. Preference for admission is given to those cases with severe distressing symptoms and the poor and destitute. All admissions are made irrespective of any caste or creed.</p>
<p>The day-to-day Medical Care is given by specially trained doctors in palliative care, in all our branches. In addition, specialist care is given by our onco-surgeon whenever needed. Other specialty doctors like dentists, skin specialists, anesthetists etc. are invited on voluntary basis to help patients whenever a specific need arises.</p>
<p>Supportive Care is given by a whole team, consisting of volunteers, social workers, occupational therapists, counselors, and religious advisors. Most of all, the family members are trained and encouraged to support the patient as best as possible.</p>
<p>In addition to the main care of our inmates, we also have the following support systems:</p>
<p>A)           Out Patient Dept (OPD)</p>
<p>B)            Day Care Services</p>
<p>C)            Home Services</p>
<p>Shanti Avedna Sadan does not have a home care service, but closely liase with other NGOs like ‘Caring Hearts’, Cancer Patients Aides Association, V-Care etc., who support these services and coordinate with the Sadan.</p>
