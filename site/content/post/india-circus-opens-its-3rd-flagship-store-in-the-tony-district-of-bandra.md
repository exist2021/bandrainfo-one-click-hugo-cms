## Krsnaa Mehta, Founder & Executive Director at India Circus

> A Godrej Venture, quotes, "Meeting the needs and demands of the consumer to create picturesque and breathable living spaces with India Circus, since with the new-normal lifestyle came some rules and restrictions, most of them which required you to isolate in your homes. Work and play both needed designated spaces. The entire journey from determining a need for wider operations to the unveiling of the Bandra store was quite challenging for India Circus, however, the brand successfully and phenomenally commenced its operations in July 2020 with the support of the entire India Circus team."
