But sometimes to our wonder our children don&#8217;t want to learn the skill we can give impart to them. This isn&#8217;t the case with Nerjis Asif Shakir, she is the grand daughter of Firoze Shakir, A prolific street photographer himself. Nerjis watching her grand father started clicking pictures as young as 18 months old. She hasn&#8217;t stopped since. and had her work recently on display at the &#8220;Art With Impact&#8221; art show and fundraiser in San Francisco. </p>
<p>This is what <a href="http://www.artwithimpact.org/mission-vision/staff-and-volunteers/iqvinder-singh/">Iquinder Singh Project Director</a> of Art with Impact has to say.</p>

<p>Narzis Asif Shakir has to be one of the youngest street photographers we know from India. Following the footsteps of her grandfather, Firoze Shakir, who is a legend in Indian photojournalism himself. Shakir is only five years old, but she never misses the opportunity to capture the life on the Indian city streets. She’s been shooting since she was 18 months old and by the way she’s going, you can expect to see more great work from her in the coming years.</p>
