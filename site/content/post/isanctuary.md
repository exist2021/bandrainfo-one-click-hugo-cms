At the time of trafficking and sale, girls have been younger than 12. Statistics show that girls that are trafficked have been known to be as young as age 5.<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/isanctuary-2.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1119 alignright" alt="isanctuary 2" src="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/isanctuary-2.jpg?resize=300%2C203&#038;ssl=1" width="300" height="203" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/isanctuary-2.jpg?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/isanctuary-2.jpg?w=597&amp;ssl=1 597w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>International Sanctuary partners with human rights rescue agencies that work with local authorities around the world to rescue victims of oppression and slavery. Rescue agencies utilize legal and investigative professionals to collect evidence of forced slavery. Once sufficient evidence is gathered, the information is brought to local authorities who work with the human rights agency to physically remove the girls and women from their situations of abuse and exploitation.</p>
<p>Though the care homes are primarily intended for minor girls, young women are permitted to stay once they turn 18 if they so choose. When the girls reach 18 years of age, they are encouraged to move to transitional group homes where they can gain more independence and gradually reintegrate into society.</p>
<p>The survivors are paid 100% above fair trade wage. Each participant has a bank account where her earnings are deposited and saved for her future when she transitions out of the aftercare home. Fair trade wage is calculated according to each country&#8217;s economic scale. Fair Trade products ensure that items were not made by slave labor. The additional funds cover the material cost, shipping, and tax.</p>
<p>iSanctuary provides medical assistance, education, skills training, life skills, leadership opportunities, employment and financial stability to survivors of human trafficking.<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ISANCTUARY3.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1124 aligncenter" alt="ISANCTUARY3" src="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ISANCTUARY3.jpg?resize=600%2C450&#038;ssl=1" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ISANCTUARY3.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ISANCTUARY3.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
