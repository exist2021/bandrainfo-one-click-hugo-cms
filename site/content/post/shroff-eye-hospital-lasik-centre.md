<p>This super-speciality hospital consists of a team of highly skilled and experienced Eye Specialists in Mumbai including surgeons, assistants and support staff to offer the finest eye care in the world.</p>
<p>Shroff Eye runs several super speciality clinics for the special purpose of preserving sight in sight-threatening conditions such as glaucoma, Uveitis, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration etc. The patient receives customized care provided by our specialists since these conditions require regular follow-up. As these conditions can cause irreversible loss of vision if poorly treated or neglected, we emphasize the need for regular follow ups as the effect of treatment on the eye may not always be constant and needs to be regularly measured by our specialist. At the clinic we record images and maintain records of your eye condition for comparison on following visits.</p>
<p><b>Diabetic retinopathy clinic</b> – is dedicated to the identification and long term care of diabetics at risk for diabetic retinopathy. The clinic is equipped with digital angiography systems, retinal sonography, various lasers, and advanced vitreoretinal surgery equipment to provide treatment to patients with even advanced forms of the disorder.</p>
<p><b>Macular degeneration clinic</b> – It is a common disorder among the aged population. Digital flourescein angiography and other tests are used to be able to accurately diagnose the condition. Treatment is provided to patients who require it using Avastine/ Lucentis injections.</p>
<p><b>Glaucoma clinic</b> – is a sight threatening and often symptomless disease due to high intra ocular pressure, which has a strong family history. All our patients are screened for glaucoma. Patient suffering from glaucoma are regularly tested using various instruments and parameters. The Humphrey computerised Visual Field Analyser [VFA] helps track prevention of further damage to the vision. Special Blue-on-yellow software [SWAP] allows early diagnosis of glaucoma suspects, especially those with a strong family history.</p>
