<p>Having established itself as the best Chinese cuisine in town, The China Village owes the credit to the ex Chef and staff of China Gate, Bandra who have come together to make it a success.</p>
<p>The China Village maintains the authentic taste and quality of food is also similar. The added advantage offered by The China Village is the reasonably priced menu which is almost 30% less than other restaurants serving similar food.</p>
<p>From the fish butter garlic to grilled sesame chicken, the grilled pomfret and the rest of the menu follow traditions of rich, robust flavours.</p>
<p>China village offers a vast repertoire of Asian Cuisine with a spectacular array of dishes that make it an inevitable gourmet offer. With an expansive menu offering options for both vegetarian and the non-vegetarian and dishes like coriander pot noodles, Tiger prawns, Mandarin Pomfret, roast lamb oyster chilly, stir fried Chinese greens, fried dumplings and wontons, mushrooms and tofu, this restaurant is a testament to fine dining.</p>
