<p>More than half of all road-related deaths in Mumbai are that of pedestrians, and over 30% of those deaths occur at intersections. This is the transformation story of HP Junction in Bandra, which sees more than 5000 vehicles and an equal number of pedestrians during rush hour.</p>
<p>In 2017 <a href="https://www.wri-india.org">WRI India</a> partnered with Mumbai Traffic Police and the MCGM to redesign the junction, for safer pedestrian and vehicular movement. A successful trial using traffic barricades, cones and paint was conducted to test the design. The changes have since been made permanent.</p>
