Leave aside the indulgence of going to Prithvi Theatre.</p>
<p>But #celebratebandra2016 got me again connected to culture, and this time, I discovered a venue called “the cuckoo club” tucked behind the candies building, this beautiful mini theatre can seat about 120 people. The place is small and very indie, just blends with the personality of Bandra culture scene. Sudiep the man who runs “The Hive” said, they needed a bigger place than the auditorium at the hive, and this was the reason they decided to set up this venue called the cuckoo club. They also have a cute cafe upstairs from where you can see candies also. My guess is the cafe here gets its stuff from candies.<br />
The auditorium has two levels like a stall &amp; a balcony. I haven&#8217;t been to the top level, so cannot comment much on that. I highly recommend you to check this place out for a intimate theatre experience. I have seen two plays here as a part of celebrating Bandra festival. One was a Marathi play on “Lavni”, and the was an English play called “The Cookie Machine”.</p>

<blockquote><p>The space, previously a banquet hall, has been cut across two levels. The 1,500sqft ground level is just a bare room — a black box theatre — which means that the stage and seating will be moveable, and the lights and sounds will be flexible. The setup will change depending on the artists’ requirements. “We’ve left some parts of it bare so that when artists come and start using it, we can modify the space based on their feedback and usage. Some of them have started rehearsing here already,” Bhatti says. The venue will host everything from music gigs and plays to installations by visual artists. They hope to seat 80 to 100 people in the audience for a show.<br />
