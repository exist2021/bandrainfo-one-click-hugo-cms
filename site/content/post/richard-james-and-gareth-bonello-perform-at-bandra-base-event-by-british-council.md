The evening was an informal gathering to share and exchange ideas for work that can be performed in 2014, to commemorate the birth centenary of the poet Dylan Thomas.</p>
<p>The event began with a short film (The Colour of Saying) which explores the vocal, lyrical, rhythmic and literary strands of Dylan Thomas&#8217; west Wales world. This was followed by a performance by two Welsh folk musicians &#8211; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_James_(musician)">Richard James</a> and Gareth Bonello. Open-ended discussions on possibilities of collaboration  followed and were encouraged to bring in your instruments/materials to test how your ideas would work, as a first step towards creating work for the centenary, in 2014.</p>
<p>Richard James is the curator of<a href="https://www.inchapters.com/?cat=6"> In Chapters</a>, a Cardiff-based music and literary event. At the very core of In Chapters is the bringing together of music and literature through collaborative work. Shabd/Gadarn takes a leaf out of this chapter and serves as a platform to facilitate such dialogue, celebrating ensuing collaborations.</p>
