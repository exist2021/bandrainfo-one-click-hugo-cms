Bandra folks will be very happy to get introduced to a very talented young film maker, a true blue Bandra boy, Kabeer Khurana. All of twenty two, this young lad is making waves not only in India, but on international Film Festival platforms as well.

## Talent abounds in Bandra!

Kabeer Khurana is a nine time international award-winning filmmaker and the co-founder of India's youngest publishing venture, Bombaykala Books. Apart from winning awards in Italy, USA and Ukraine, his films have received several festival selections internationally, including the Global University Film Awards, and his films have been screened at other festivals in Brazil, Prague, Singapore, Indonesia, Morocco, Croatia, and more.

One of Kabeer’s recent short films is the very popular film Karma Cafe, starring Amole Gupte who made Taare Zameen Par and Stanley ka Dabba and it has been produced by Anjum Rizvi of A Wednesday fame. Amole is also a Bandra resident, and he was gracious enough to act gratis in Kabeer’s film. Mr. Gupte is currently working on directing a film based on the biography of ace shuttler Saina Nehwal.

Kabeer, has studied History and Political Science from Ashoka University and it was his great interest in films that led him to change direction. He is a self taught film director though he has an impeccable family back ground in film making. His grandfather Bhimsain was one of the founders of the animation medium in India, and his father Kireet Khurana carried on this legacy. If memory serves me right, Bhimsainji was the producer and director of the award winning film Gharonda, starring Amol Palekar and Zarina Wahab. So Kabeer certainly has learnt his skills at the alter of the highest film talent.

> His mentor, the legendary Saeed Mirza, is another film industry stalwart and is also a Bandra resident!

Kabeer’s films have a really wide range of style and content. His animated film Dali, won the highest honour, the Audience Choice Award at the Flatlands Dance Film Festival in Illinois (USA) and his short film Hangout (2020) was released recently on Disney+ Hotstar. This film is set in the present pandemic times, in which a young couple connect online while they are working from home during the lockdown . So it is very pertinent to these times and there is an instant connect. Hopefully Hangout will also release in English on Amazon Prime, in order to get a larger international audience.

Apart from from direction, Kabeer has also assisted film maker Zoya Akhtar on Ghost Stories (2020) for Netflix. Currently he is working on a film called Suttebazi, a slang expression for smoking amongst the young. Kabeer has written and directed this film and the background music score for it has been done by Emiliano Mazzenga, who is an Oscar selected music composer from Hollywood. Suttebazi is about a mother daughter relationship which is stormy at the best of times though underlying it there is deep love.

This film stars Susmita Sen’s daughter Renee as the young girl and has Komal Chhabria essaying the role of her mother. Komal is also a Bandra resident! She kick started her career in theatre five years ago and has since featured in films like Padmaavat, Sui Dhaaga, Good Newss & Mardaani 2, in addition to acting in popular webseries and commercials in which she has worked with award winning directors. I have seen Komal act the powerful role of Savitri in the immortal Hindi play Aadhe Adhure, a role that deservedly earned her accolades from theatre aficionados.

The young Kabeer wears many hats as he is also the founder of several youth-based social organizations like Navrang and The Mumbai Art Collective, for which he was featured on the cover story of India Today. Kabeer is also a part-time graphic designer, illustrator and writer on film theory.

> This young film maker certainly does our Bandra community proud!
