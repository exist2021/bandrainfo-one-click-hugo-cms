On 14th March [Zoru Bathena](https://twitter.com/zoru75), an activist who regularly points out illegal hoardings on the streets and also is a Tree Activist bought to the notice of [defacement of Bandra Fort](https://twitter.com/zoru75/status/1370994192776798209/photo/2) by a nameplate claiming the credits to Ashish Shelar.

Rahul N Kanal a core committee member of Yuva Sena also pointed out the [relevant laws](https://twitter.com/Iamrahulkanal/status/1370997047743016960) which are meant to safeguard such heritage structures.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These are the laws safe guarding our heritage structures... such archeological structures should not be used for publicity and strict action must be taken... Bandra fort is our pride and doesn’t belong to any political party or political worker... <a href="https://t.co/FfaljzJzXZ">https://t.co/FfaljzJzXZ</a> <a href="https://t.co/PRi4g6oDjv">pic.twitter.com/PRi4g6oDjv</a></p>&mdash; Rahul.N.Kanal (@Iamrahulkanal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Iamrahulkanal/status/1370997047743016960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2021</a></blockquote>

## Maharashtra Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 1995 and Heritage Laws

> India’s built heritage is well-protected by Article 49 of the Constitution: “It shall be the obligation of the State to protect every monument or place or object of artistic or historic interest, (declared by or under law made by Parliament) to be of national importance, from spoliation, disfigurement, destruction, removal, disposal or export, as the case may be.”[[1]](https://www.orfonline.org/#_edn1) Further, Article 51 A (f) states: “It shall be the duty of every citizen of India to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture; and (g) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures.”[[2]](https://www.orfonline.org/#_edn2)  [www.orfonline.org](https://www.orfonline.org/research/protecting-indias-built-heritage-against-natural-disasters-50592/) 

## Safeguards against such defacement

Why do we need activists to be ever vigilant. There should be a review as to how the process of putting up name boards work. What is the system? This kind of oversight is not only an embarrassment to Mr Shelar but to all Bandra people who have vested their trust in him.
