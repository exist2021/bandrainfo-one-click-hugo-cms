<p>Rui is a 25 year old salwar kameez fashion house started by two sisters &#8211; Asha Sood, Kanchan Ganatra. Rui has three outlets in Mumbai &#8211; at Kemps Corner, Phoenix Mills and Bandra and one outlet in Bangalore.</p>
<p>Despite their minimal knowledge of what the market required, they were aware of the dearth of quality customized ethnic wear available. So Rui was born.</p>
<p>Established in 1985, Asha and Kanchan have successfully managed to convert Rui into a brand that caters to women of all shapes, sizes and fashion sensibilities. Rui also showcases a few selected pieces of talented designers from other cities giving them an opportunity to display their collection at the store.</p>
<p>With a vast and unique collection, Asha and Kanchan hand pick every piece and offer it at affordable prices to their large and faithful clientele who can&#8217;t help running back for more.</p>
<p>Rui uses blockprinting to print motifs on the ground fabric with pigment dyes, which allowed subtle nuances of tones and colours. Rui uses this with a combination of delicate embroidery, highlighting selective areas of a garment. Similar blockprinting is done on the dupatta as a co-ordinate, creating an elegant ensemble. Rui has carved a niche for itself with these vibrant blockprints, artistically fused with hand and machine embroidery.</p>
