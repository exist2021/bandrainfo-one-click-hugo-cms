Exuberant, hospitable, fun loving, sophisticated and warm, with a penchant for good food and the good life. This imagery is almost tangible and is brought to life via the latest venture of Mamta Sekhri and Poonam Soni.</p>
<p>The enterprising sisters have a diverse and colorful background. Poonam is a lawyer and Mamta a fashion designer. They first started their entrepreneurial escapade with Wild n Whacky, a popular boutique store. After that success they decided to make their first foray into the field of food and hospitality with the Chaat Café specializing in “Dilli”Chaats and Indian fast food. Then came Paapa Pancho in association with Adman Prahlad Kakkar which introduced the concept of dhaba / home cooked style of Punjabi food (and not mughlai as served elsewhere). This restaurant is a benchmark in Bandra and enjoys immense patronage.</p>
<p>The food at Papa Pancho is simple and wholesome. The main courses like Pindi Chicken, Mutton Rasedar, Baingan Bharta, Rajma Chawal, Gobi Mattar, Sarson Da Saag (veg), amongst others are served with complimentary Dal Makhani, Dahi, Rice/Phulkas/Paratha. The menu is extensive and serves home cooked styled dishes from the Tandoor, the Kadhai, the Tawaa as well as numerous Rice, Dal and Roti preparations.</p>
<p>Poonam and Mamta are committed to adding another dimension to Mumbai’s dining experience by creating a unique combination of home styled Punjabi cuisine with modern and sophisticated Punjabi culture. All this in a warm, friendly, neighborhood restaurant.</p>
