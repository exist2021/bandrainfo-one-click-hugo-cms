<p dir="auto">I like to roam around the Khar station area, there some good places there to grab a bite like Trupti Farsan, Sindhu, etc.</p>

<p>Abhisekh the owner of Urban Street cafe had told me a long time back he was planning to open a cafe in Bandra and was looking for a place. I suppose he had to settle for Khar. </p>
<p>The Urban Street cafe is located on the Khar station road, and about a couple of minutes walk from the Khar station. The place is rustic with seating inside and outside in the open alfresco section.</p>

<p>The hot tea coffee is priced at Rs 40/50 while the cold beverages go to up to 150 Rs. The snacks are moderate priced, and they have a unique menu, with items from falafel showarma to Chole Bature. They also have a love counter for chat, with Pani poori and other stuff. </p>
<p>While the place gives a much-needed respite as there is not any place where you can sit and enjoy a cuppa. The service is disappointing; the running of the cafe is left to the staff and there seemed to be no one with authority present.</p>

<p>The waiters won&#8217;t bother to check on you unless you scream your order to them. Ofcourse the incessant chattering of TV was also annoying, but I saw a few couples on a date cozying up in the inside section. </p>
<p>I feel the place has a great potential, only if Abhisekh finds a good manager. I look forward to spending some time there, whenever I am Khar station side.</p>
