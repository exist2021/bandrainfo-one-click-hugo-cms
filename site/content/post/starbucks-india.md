<p>Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better. It was true when the first Starbucks opened in 1971, and it’s just as true today.</p>
<p>Today, with more than 15,000 stores in 50 countries, Starbucks is the premier roaster and retailer of speciality coffee in the world. And with every cup, we strive to bring both our heritage and an exceptional experience to life.</p>
<p>It happens millions of times each week – a customer receives a drink from a Starbucks barista – but each interaction is unique.</p>
<p>We make sure everything we do honour that connection – from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.</p>
<p>From our beginnings as a single store over forty years ago, in every place that we’ve been, and every place that we touch, we&#8217;ve tried to make it a little better than we found it.</p>
<p>To say Starbucks purchases and roasts high-quality whole bean coffees is very true. That’s the essence of what we do – but it hardly tells the whole story.</p>
<p>Our coffeehouses have become a beacon for coffee lovers everywhere. Why do they insist on Starbucks? Because they know they can count on genuine service, an inviting atmosphere and a superb cup of expertly roasted and richly brewed coffee every time.</p>
<p><b>Expect More Than Coffee</b></p>
<p>We are passionate purveyors of coffee and everything else that goes with a rewarding coffeehouse experience. We also offer a selection of premium Tata® Tazo® teas, fine pastries and other delectable treats to please the taste buds. And the music you hear in store is chosen for its artistry and appeal.</p>
<p>People come to Starbucks to chat, meet up or work. We’re a neighbourhood gathering place, a part of the daily routine – and we couldn’t be happier about it. Get to know us and you’ll see: we are so much more than what we brew.</p>
<p><b>Being a responsible Company:</b></p>
<p><b>Community</b></p>
<p>Whether you are working, sending e-mails or browsing online in our coffeehouse – we&#8217;ll make it easy to connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>Starbucks is committed to helping communities thrive everywhere we do business. We strive to support connections in communities around the world so that we can make a positive, relevant and enduring impact. Using Our Scale for Good, Local Relevance/Global Reach, Working with Others, Innovation.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b></p>
<p>We’re finding ways to minimise our environmental footprint, tackle climate change and inspire others to do the same. Reusable cups, greener cups, composting and other initiatives have been launched to reduce our environmental impact.</p>
<p><b>Ethical Sourcing</b></p>
<p>We’re committed to buying and serving the highest-quality, responsibly grown, ethically traded coffee to help create a better future for farmers.</p>
<p><b>Diversity</b></p>
<p>By welcoming a diversity of people and ideas to our business, we create more opportunities for learning and success that benefit customers, partners (employees) and suppliers.</p>
<p><b>Starbucks in India:</b></p>
<p>In October 2012, Tata Starbucks Limited, the 50/50 joint venture between Starbucks Coffee Company (Nasdaq: SBUX) and Tata Global Beverages Limited, opened the doors to the first Starbucks store in India. This flagship store is located at the historic Elphinstone Building, Horniman Circle, Mumbai and marks the beginning of the iconic brand’s India journey.</p>
