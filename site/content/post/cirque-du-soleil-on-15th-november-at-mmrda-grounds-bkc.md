<p>Audiences in India will very soon experience the magnificence of the world’s biggest live-entertainment phenomena, Cirque du Soleil, which is being brought to India by BookMyShow. Citibank has come on board as the presenting partner for the world premiere of Cirque du Soleil’s show ‘BAZZAR’ in India. The shows will start from 15th November 2018 in Mumbai, and from 25th December 2018 in New Delhi, before moving to other markets.<br><br>Thus far Cirque Du Soleil, which originated in Montreal, Canada, has regaled more than 190 million spectators in over 450 cities around the world, with their stunning shows. The company sells over 12 million tickets per year and has almost 1,400 performing artists from close to 60 different countries.<br><br><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_0103.jpg?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1" class="wp-image-12675 size-full" height="427" width="640" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_0103.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_0103.jpg?resize=500%2C334&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_0103.jpg?resize=280%2C187&amp;ssl=1 280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Unlike any other entertainment company, Cirque du Soleil will not just visit Mumbai and Delhi but will infuse our city’s culture inside The Big Top, the main tent, where the performances will take place. The Big Top itself is a wonder that takes six days to set up and stands tall at 19 meters (62 feet) high and is 41 meters (135 feet) in diameter accommodating 1500 people at once. This will be built in BKC, and this is where the shows will take place.</p>


<p>A cast and crew of 62 people will be travelling to India from over 13 different countries and close to 700 tonnes of equipment will be carried via 25 sea containers. The show will feature a range of acrobatic marvels ranging from teeterboard, portage, acrobatic bike, contortion, duo roller skate, duo trapeze, aerial rope, and live music, with one singer and two musicians on stage. In addition, the performance of the show BAZZAR, will have impressive scenes and sets, as well as all the other key Cirque du Soleil elements and features.</p>


<p>Written and Directed by Susan Gaudreau, Cirque du Soleil – BAZZAR will capture the high-energy excitement, the sounds, colours and spirit of a traditional Indian ‘bazaar’, and this is what inspired the name of the show, BAZZAR. Lead by their maestro in the show, the troupe comes together to invent a whimsical one-of-a-kind universe in a place where the unexpected is expected, while the colourful group reimagines, rebuilds and reinvents vibrant scenes in an artistic, acrobatic game of order and disorder.</p>


<p>Daniel Lamarre, President and CEO, Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group, is very excited to bring this show to Indian audiences, who have never been exposed to Cirque du Soleil before. “Designing a show specifically to introduce Cirque du Soleil to a totally new audience was an exciting creative challenge,” says Susan Gaudreau, Show Director.</p>
