<p>Rays Café &amp; Pizzeria was started by Hemant Mehta a computer systems engineer from University of Massachusetts and his wife Rashmi a fashion designer from NIFT in February 2010.</p>
<p>Rays Café opened as a small casual dining neighborhood kind of place offering medium crust stone oven pizzas to the largely cosmopolitan residents of Bandra and its surrounding suburbs. In keeping with the Portuguese influence Bandra is known for, the Mehta’s kept the old world charm whilst remodeling a tiny 127 year old cottage in both the decor and ambience. Warm wooden furniture, sunshine yellow walls, a good view into a wine cellar and huge white umbrellas dominate the outside whereas clean white walls, wooden rafters with a sloping roof and bright cushions dominate the A/c section which houses an open kitchen where the pizzialo rolls and bakes the pizzas once the orders get placed.</p>

<p>Located right behind the Godrej Natures basket it is in fact the view of their wine cellar that one gets a view of whilst dining at Ray’s al fresco section. The pizzas at Ray’s have fast gained popularity due to their fresh ingredients crusty dough and tomato sauce which is made daily on the premises under Rashmi’s guidance.</p>

<p>The hearty sandwiches are made with only the choicest meats and fresh vegetables. Ray’s Café also creates uniquely satisfying salads that are topped with homemade dressings. And of course, Ray’s  desserts include the best apple pie referred to by many as a “slice of heaven”.</p>
<p>Ray’s is really the place now known for lunch, a light snack or dinner.</p>
<p>You will also see regulars enjoy fresh brewed coffee as they simply enjoy the music whilst surfing the net.</p>
