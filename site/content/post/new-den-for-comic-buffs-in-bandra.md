<p><strong>As India sees its first comics store open its first shop in the city, The Guide stepped into Vimanika Comics&#8217; flagship space at Bandra that will tempt hipsters, mythology freaks and geeks for a read and much more.</strong></p>
<p>Hued in red and black, the Bandra outlet that claims to be India’s first comics store beckoned us in to flip through various facets of the award-winning Vimanika Comics. Although author Amish Tripathi contemporarised Indian mythology in an unprecedented fashion, Vimanika Comics douses epic mythological protagonists with an Indo-Western brush. For instance, Karna is metamorphosed into a business tycoon in The Sixth: Legend of Karna and Kalki, the tenth incarnation of Lord Vishnu, acts as the mouthpiece for environmental concerns in I am Kalki series.</p>
<p>Apart from stocking up on graphic narratives (comics and graphic novels), the store stocks T-shirts, posters, canvas paintings and other knick knacks. All are docked up with Vimanika characters that characteristically exude a martial look with six pack abs reminiscent of their superhero appearance.</p>

<p>KaranVir Arora, Managing Director and Editor in Chief of Vimanika Books, stresses the need to connect with youth about Indian culture on home turf as well as worldwide. Tracing his own influence, Arora cites his brother’s passion for a visualisation of a narrative that has led him this far. The company started in 2008, hoped to draw attention to the need of Indian comic books’ company.</p>

<p>The colour scheme of the store becomes justified when one ponders over most of the covers that are streaked in red with protagonists on covers that seem to be striving against all odds. Most of the merchandise paints a similar picture evoking a Punkish aura. We specially found Yamaraja, lord of death and Lord Shiva’s digital paintings worth for keeps.</p>
