<p>After waiting for months, Mumbaikars will finally be able to avail the hybrid bus service to and from Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), come March 19. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis flagged off the service yesterday, after 25 buses arrived in the city last year. While these buses will run on four routes and will also provide shuttle services, 80 more of these have already been sanctioned for the city.</p>
