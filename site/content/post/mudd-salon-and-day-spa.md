<p><strong>About Alina Jetha</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/alina-jetha.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1183 alignright" alt="alina jetha" src="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/alina-jetha.jpg?resize=200%2C300&#038;ssl=1" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/alina-jetha.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/alina-jetha.jpg?w=372&amp;ssl=1 372w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Alina Jetha got totally absorbed into the salon atmosphere as an apprentice since her Mother Fatima Jetha ran a Salon since last 26 years. She got hands on in &#8211; salon training which a professional course could never offer.</p>
<p>Armed with practical as well as professional experience, she conceived MUDDSALON &amp; DAY SPA.</p>
<p>Alina’s passion for her profession makes her constantly work on different advance degrees in skin, hair and body spa, to keep up with changing trends.Alina also launched her own boutique MALMAL at Linking Road, Bandra in 2009.</p>
<p>MUDD SALON &amp; DAY SPA is a home away from home. No clinical feel, but pure warmth. This is reflected in combination of the experienced staff who are a part and parcel of the MUDD family and its growth.</p>
<p>MUDD does not believe in MAGIC! The process of SKIN&amp; HAIR care here is literally the replication of the care one takes in one’s own home. A quick fix solution like bleach is not seen as a cure here. MUDD believes in the power of caring and the betterment of skin rather than just whitening it for the moment. The treatments are for all part of the body &amp;skin, hair hands &amp; feet which reflects MUDD’s ideology.</p>
