<p>The objectives of the Trust is to enrich and empower people’s lives through integrated, holistic, sustainable social models.</p>
<p>It encompasses 3 critical areas of living:</p>
<p><b>Anando &#8211; Education:</b></p>
<p>The motive is to realise the untapped potential of India’s rural children and empower them and to recognise them as a major human resource. We believe that no child should be forced to drop out of school.</p>
<p><b>Anant:</b></p>
<p>To ensure holistic development of a child we also believe in enhancing his creative aspect of the child. Anant was initiated to give sufficient exposure to our culture and to bring out the creativity within them.</p>
<p>With the belief that music has the capacity to calm the mind and direct all energies towards enhancing creativity and better academic performance, the Anant Programme was initiated for selected Anando children. The learning of the tabla, undergoing vocal training and learning folk dance from trained teachers have seen many blossoming into well adjusted children.</p>

<p><b>Awakening (Jagruti) &#8211; Holistic Community:</b></p>
<p>To create a unique holistic, joyous social environment that will enrich lives through mutual benefits and empower its beneficiaries. The project aims to reach out to women, children and senior citizens through setting up of the Jeevan Asha Community Centre, a Children’s Home and a Senior Citizens’ Home.</p>
<p>The project also includes setting up of a Medical Diagnostic Centre along with a Mobile Medical Unit for the benefit of the local communities residing in and around Karjat Taluka to provide diagnostic service/medical guidance for the economically marginalized rural households with focus on Women and Children in remote areas of said region.</p>
<p>The location of Project Jagruti is Tiware Village, about 6 kms away from Karjat Railway Station, Karjat Taluka, Raigad District, Maharashtra.</p>
<p>Livelihood/Skill Development training programmes initiated at the Community Centre so far:</p>

<p><b>Angan &#8211; Health: </b></p>

<p>And the task will continue&#8230; step by step, impacting one by one … thereby adding to the bunch of empowered citizens with corresponding reduction from the ‘other’ side, soon hoping for a day, when there is no one left in the &#8216;other&#8217; dreaded side.</p>
