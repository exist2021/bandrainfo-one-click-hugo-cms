<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kes-logo.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-5001 alignright" alt="kes logo" src="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kes-logo.jpg?resize=125%2C120&#038;ssl=1" width="125" height="120" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>&#8220;KHAR EDUCATION SOCIETY&#8221; is a registered educational public trust that was founded in the year 1934 by devoted Social worker late Shri Veerbalbhai Mehta with &#8220;MONTESSORI &amp; PRIMARY&#8221; Classes. Just to meet the preliminary needs of Gujarati Children-in the then tiny area of Khar &#8211; a suburb of Bombay.</p>
<p>Under the inspiration and guidance of late Shri Gurudayal Malikji, and advocate saint -who stood for idealism in the children &#8211; both these institutions served the Gujarati society for a good number of years. However, both these institutions had teething trouble of overcoming financial stringencies and various other difficulties. For administrative convenience, financial stability and to facilitate the student&#8217;s right from Montessori to Secondary on a gradual scale both these institutions were amalgamated in the year 1946 with a decision that the same should be managed by &#8220;KHAR EDUCATION SOCIETY&#8221;.</p>
<p>At this very time a capital donation was received from Messrs Maganlal Maneklal Sonawala &amp; Co. and the management of &#8220;Khar Education Society (KES)&#8221; gave impetus to our present changed name of &#8220;SHRI M.M. PUPILS OWN SCHOOL AND SHARDA MANDIR&#8221;. KES was fortunate to have valuable selfless services of late Gurudayal Malikji and Smt. Vimlaben Setalwad, who used to take personal interest in the regular management as well as upliftment and expansion of school. They also contributed their time in the collection of funds as well. We should also make special mention of Shri Chottubhai Marfatia who also rendered worthwhile services for our institution.</p>
<p>In 1949, with the performance of the Mangal Puja on Vasant Panchami, KES&#8217;s new building on the present plot was erected and the first two stories were inaugurated in 1950. Since then KES is sincerely putting its efforts with the primary aim of an all round development along with education. In 1959, technical section was also added to accommodate increased strength of children, one more section was added to the society&#8217;s premises.</p>
<p>This oath was adobpted by Shri Jhangirji Vakil. Imbibed with high sense of moral duty,he decided to spread the light of literacy &amp; dispel the darkness of ignorance.</p>
<p>Late Shri Jhangiriji Vakil was the visionary founder who saw the needs of children &amp; laid the foundation of educational institution in 1929 in Pune known as &#8220;Pupils Own School&#8221; and later in 1934 shifted to Mumbai,amalagamated with Sharda Mandir and M/s. Maganlal Maneklal Sonawala under the banner of &#8216;Khar Education Society&#8217;.</p>
<p>Since then Khar Education Society has completed its noteworthy &amp; dedicated 74 years of services in the field of education catering to the needs of the society.</p>
<p>The Khar Education Society is well established with its flagship.</p>
