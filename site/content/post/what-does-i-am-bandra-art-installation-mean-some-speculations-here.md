<p>I wonder why no one has raised this question before. I LOVE MUMBAI was followed by I LOVE BANDRA also #BANDRA.</p>
<p>The Big junction which leads to Western Express Highway or LJ Road has a traffic island with an art installation loudly proclaiming &#8221; I AM BANDRA&#8221; .</p>
<p>This installation was done somewhere in June 2016. There is a Bandra Buzz article on Tyrell in their June Edition. Tyrell Vallederes the man behind the installation is featured on September here on <a href="https://baysidejournal.com/tyrell-valladares-the-man-behind-the-i-am-bandra-artwork/">bayside journal</a> . The Bayside article discusses Tyrell’s work but not why the installation is named is “ I AM BANDRA” and Not “ I AM IN BANDRA”. Even the <a href="https://www.metalheadstudio.com/portfolio/i-am-bandra/">artists website</a> doesn’t list the explanation.</p>
<h2>So Lets talk about, What does “I AM BANDRA” signify?</h2>
<p>The recent protest about Gauri Lankesh murder had lead to the hashtag #IAMGAURI . I haven’t met a single Bandraite proclaiming “ I AM BANDRA”.</p>
<p>We all love flaunting our Bandra privilege saying “ I am a bandra boy’ or “ I am a bandra girl”. We all like to see people’s jaw drop when we say “ I live in Bandra” which is sometimes followed by an unbelievable expression asking us &#8211; Bandra East? . Nope Bandra West.</p>
<p>The grammar nazi in me is a bit peeved with this installation. Perhaps the artist wants to communicate <strong>Bandra is a state of mind</strong>? But the very act of flaunting the same, makes it look so uncool. This is the only sense I can make of it.</p>
<p><em>However, I asked my social media subscribers and I got some alternative answers. </em></p>

<li>By @thenaziakhan &#8211; The same way when someone says &#8216;im wearing manish malhotra&#8217; ask yourself how can somewhere wear a person&#x1f602; jst kidding&#x1f609;</li>
<li>@aestheticugly &#8211; hey mean the people who live in bandra give character to the area,..? So hence &#8220;I am bandra&#8221;. Without the people/community bandra won&#8217;t be the same.</li>
<li>@meghashrimali -More like representing the place. If say for example, you are in a room full of foreigners, you represent India, more like &#8211; I am India. Same way.</li>
