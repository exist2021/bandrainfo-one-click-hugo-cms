I am looking at how far the fame of Bandra is rising. After being named by timeout as one of the 4[0 coolest neighbourhoods in the world](https://www.timeout.com/coolest-neighbourhoods-in-the-world). It has been a long time since Bandra has taken the wind out of Sobo sails. Vishal Bharghav in his [money control piece](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/the-rise-and-rise-of-bandra-mumbais-most-vibrant-piece-of-real-estate-5861851.html) articulates why the power of Bandra has risen and risen and displaced Sobo as the **“most vibrant”** piece of real estate in Mumbai.

Now the fame of Bandra is even haunting Sobo in places like London. It has displaced the 53-year-old north Indian restaurant in London by brands Bandra Bhai and Pali Hill. Bandra bhai is an underground cocktail bar while Pali Hill will offer an eclectic menu of regional sharing places.

> Both the brands are the brainchild of Kabir Suri and Rahul Khanna of Azure Hospitality founded in 2009 which operates several brands in India, they run colourful Mamogoto in Bandra at hill road.
