Located off Pali Market, this <b>62-seater New York-style eatery</b> offers guests a combination of privacy and comfort, and has become the highlight of the foodie paradise that Bandra is today.</p>
<p>Indigo Deli Bandra has nearly <b>round-the-clock operations seven days a week – 9am to 1.30am</b>, with last orders being taken at 12am. Sticking to the original concept of “restaurant with retail”, <b>The Deli Shop</b> will continue to be the gourmet section focusing on our inhouse bakery items and condiments; take away salads, marinated meats, as well as dining accessories.</p>
<p>“Our success formula has been synonymous with our fantastic team, with <b>Director de Cuisine Rahul Akerkar &amp; Executive Chef Jaydeep Mukherjee</b> leading the way in the kitchen by creating a delectable menu focused on <b>creative comfort foods</b> and <b>Sameep Padora</b> being the mastermind behind the charming &amp; elegant décor,” says Malini Akerkar, Director Brand, MarComm &amp; Design of deGustibus Hospitality.</p>
<p><b>Food</b></p>
<p>Originally conceptualized by <b>Chef Rahul Akerkar &amp; Chef Jaydeep Mukherjee, the menu at the Delis is brimming with dishes that are sophisticated versions of popular comfort foods like Mac n Cheese, Chicken Salad Sandwich, Hot Dogs, etc. </b>Those familiar with Indigo Deli will be glad to know that the menu at Bandra will remain the same with wholesome burgers and sandwiches, crispy airy pizzas, seasonal soups and salads, but with a few additions like Chef Rahul Akerkar’s original creation called <b>Eggs on The Beach that he enjoys describing as “the tropical cousin of the Eggs Benedict”, </b>or more simply<b> Poached Eggs with Hollandaise Sauce served with Crab Cakes and Crispy Bacon. </b></p>
<p>All-time favourites like the Pulled Pork Burger, Chicken Wings, Eggs Divinity, Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich, Chorizo Pizza, etc, will be seen on the menu, and so will the moreish dessert choices that will continue to tempt with the Baked Yoghurts, Souffles, Cheesecakes, Cupcakes, and the like.</p>

<p>The Deli Shop is a <b>quintessential ‘retail gourmet store’ located within the restaurant </b>to offer diners the convenience of shopping before or after a meal. From freshly baked goodies, coffees, teas and take-away salads, marinated meats and patés, the Deli Shop is a one-stop-shop for all things gourmet.</p>
<p>Freshly <b>baked treats</b> range from buttery croissants, bagels, teatime cakes, baguettes, lavash and breadsticks for dips to moreish tropical fruit pies and tarts, danish pastries, gateaux and made-to-order cookies.</p>
<p>Besides these we also have our in-house artisanal range of condiments that are produced in our very own kitchens and some of the most sought-after cookbooks and dining accessories by Le Creuset, Bodum &amp; Mukul Goyal.</p>
<p>As with all the other Delis, we will continue to sell <b>hampers for gifting</b> during festive season and otherwise, as well as offer a <b>take-away menu</b> for small private parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Décor</b></p>
<p>This being renowned architect <b>Sameep Padora’s</b> second Indigo Deli, the first being at the Palladium, he has once again created a stunning space that is aimed at making the diner feel warm and relaxed.</p>
<p><b>Director Malini Akerkar</b>, known for her design sensibilities &amp; aesthetic affiliations, says about the décor, “In Padora-esque fashion, the Indigo Deli Bandra project has been created using sophisticated materials, which has taken the form of the Indigo Deli brand to amplify its sensuousness.”</p>
<p>The spatial setup of this Deli is suggestive of privacy but within a connected space. We have tried to achieve this by using interconnected seating pod-booths of copper that sashay through a space fractured by low ceiling heights and columns. The retail shelving, an essential component at all our Delis, resembles sculpted extensions of the wall that binds the inner dining with the outer court.</p>

<p><b>Behind the Scene</b></p>
<p>What started in 2005 with Indigo Deli Colaba, as a means to serve the time-restricted, quality-conscious diner, has today become the jugular vein of the city’s dining scene. At that time, <b>Principals Rahul and Malini Akerkar</b> recognized the market potential of this segment as well as the need for a “restaurant with retail” concept, and thus became patrons of the concept of a delicatessen as a scalable and replicable module as part of the company’s expansion plans. The second Indigo Deli opened in the suburb of Andheri in 2008, which as believed soon became “an integral part of the city’s culinary-scape”. The third and most ambitious 4.500-sq-ft Indigo Deli opened at Palladium in 2010, and has since become every shopper and yuppie’s favourite haunt, packing in nearly 500 diners a day.</p>
