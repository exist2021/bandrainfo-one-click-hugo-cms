<p>It is this philosophy that eventually marked the birth of a big daddy of a fashion house &#8211; &#8216;And Designs India Limited&#8217;, the brainchild of renowned designer Anita Dongre, Meena Sehra &amp; Mukesh Sawlani.</p>
<p>Today, 40 cities, 400 points of sale spread across the length and breadth of India and 14 years later, the company rears three exclusive brands under its sequinned umbrella – ANITA DONGRE, AND, GLOBAL DESI; and gives everyone a chance to look uber-desirable.</p>
<p>With offshore dreams and plenty of nationwide projects, here’s proudly presenting one of India’s finest fashion houses, And Designs India Ltd.</p>
<p>Everybody has a way of expressing themselves. Some use words. Some use fashion. Fashion has the ability to make a powerful statement. The new age woman wants clothes that articulate her  individuality, which is why, she experiments with different styles to stand apart. Her life is filled with influences that are both traditional as well as western and she is equally comfortable with both.</p>

The collection is universal and has international appeal. Any woman, wherever in the world she may be and who loves the vibrancy of Indian prints and influences, will find a little bit of herself here.</p>
<p>Global Desi is a bright spark of colour and imagination but most importantly, its passion.</p>
<p>Global Desi blends cuts, color, embellishments and the vibrancy of Indian fabrics into kurtas that you can team with a churidar/salwar/patiala or even leggings impeccably, to help you create your own unique style mantra. From funky t-shirts with Indian motifs and block printed kurtas to colourful jewellery and bags, Global Desi has them all.</p>
