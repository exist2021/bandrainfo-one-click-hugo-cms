<p dir="auto">Yamu&#8217;s Panchayat has taken the Panshop to the next level with a walk-in store, who knows next we will have a Pancafe in Bandra, where people can chew their pan and spit in the spittoon?</p>
<p>They have all kinds of Pan; I tried the conservative Meetha Pan which sells at 40 Rs. They also sell Hookas, pipes and stuff.</p>
