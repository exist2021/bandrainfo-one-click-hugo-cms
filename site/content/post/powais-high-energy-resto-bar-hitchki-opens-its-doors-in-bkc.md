+++


<p dir="auto">Mumbai, India, 3rd December, 2017: After receiving an overwhelming response in Powai with its quirky cocktails and delectable regional cuisine, HITCHKI is all set to open its new outlet in BKC, while bringing a whole new spin on many of our childhood favorites. Replicating its flagship outlet, HITCHKI BKC, suitably reflects its Hindi meaning ‘hiccup’, while recalling the memories of the passed time, in a contemporary chic setting. With several new additions to its diverse menu, the outlet surely upholds the elements of nostalgia through its dining experience as well as in its food and bar offerings.</p>
<p>The new outlet will also imbibe the nostalgic elements that made Hitchki’s flagship outlet a walk back in time with quirky ceiling fans that have lights attached and wood paneled walls. With a chic diner ambience during the day that transforms into a buzzing party spot at night the outlets vibe is classic yet contemporary with vintage upholstered chairs and diner style seating, a mirrored wall and retro printed tables.</p>
