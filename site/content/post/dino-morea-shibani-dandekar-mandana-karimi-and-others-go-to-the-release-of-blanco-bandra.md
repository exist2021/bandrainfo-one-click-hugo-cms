<p><strong>Blanco and Bombay Cocktail Bar</strong> in Andheri is a huge success. Seeing this, <strong>Buena Vida Leisure PVT LTD</strong> launched its second Greek-inspired space in the midst of the Buzzing suburbs of Bandra, with a white theme.</p>
<p>This launch was attended by Bollywood actor , MTV VJ, and actor <strong>Shibani Dandekar</strong>, <strong>RJ Malishka</strong>, Actor – <strong>Bruna Abdullah</strong>, singer-songwriter <strong>Mansi Scott</strong> and many more.</p>
<p>Continuing the same zest and the inspiration of Blue and White, <strong>Blanco</strong> launched with the theme of “White Night”, drawing its inspiration from the vibrant and artistic spaces of Greece and Spain.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Shibani Dandekar</strong> shared,</p>
<p><em>“It’s great to be here at the opening night of the Blanco, it has got such an incredible energy and I love the décor and actually Greece is one of the places that I really want to visit so I am so happy that they are bringing in the Greek and Greek food to Bandra. It’s an incredible idea, It has got a very fresh vibe and I think it’s going to be one of the hot spots in town for sure. I see a lot of us getting together just like on a week night even on a weekend. I am really excited to see how well this place does.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mansi Scott</strong> said,</p>
<p><em>“I am Glad Blanco has opened up with a nice Mediterranean feel and fact. When I saw the pictures, what got me here was the outside Mediterranean space, it’s lovely. I have tried the food, it’s very cool and great service. It’s fun to be here.”</em></p>
