<p>Finally a bar where I can go and chill out. So what&#8217;s different about this place.? Chairs/sofa&#8217;s !! I have a thing for comfortable seatings, maybe it&#8217;s because of my impoverished childhood or some fetish. But the sofa&#8217;s and the chairs are really comfy here, its like sitting in your living room!</p>
<p><strong>Drinks</strong>&#8211;</p>
<p>I had gone there on Thursday for a standup gig which was also a bar night. (Drink all you can at Rs 850/- per person) . Also they have a super happy hours on weekdays ( upto Thursdays) till 11pm. So I ordered a glass of wine, to start my experience and handed over my card, which for some reason wouldn&#8217;t swipe, my guess is the card swiper didn&#8217;t know his job). The drinks are reasonably priced at cocktails for Rs 350/ upwards. A King fisher Beer would cost you around 225/- Rs.</p>

<p><strong>Food</strong> &#8211;</p>
<p>I wanted a Middle East mezze platter from the menu but was told it&#8217;s not available , then I asked for Quesadilla and waited till I was served some bruschetta. I was extremely hungry and ate up the mediocre looking bruschetta&#8217;s complaining mildly about the mixed order.</p>
<p><strong>Wifi</strong> &#8211;</p>
<p>The guy on the bar stool next to me introduced to me as manager/owner was friendly and helpful except he had forgotten the wifi password for the connection which worked.</p>
<p><strong>Service</strong> &#8211;</p>
<p>They have new people who are pretty rustic and clueless. So don&#8217;t expect to be enthralled by the service.</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong> &#8211;</p>
<p>Now I didn&#8217;t ask the DJ&#8217;s name, but we seemed to have a telepathic connection after 2 glasses of wine and he was playing just the kind of music which made be hangout there for a while gradually sipping my wine.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong> &#8211;</p>
<p>Iam happy with this bar, it&#8217;s comfortable with a rich decor, kind of affordably priced bar menu and avoidable food. I would go on a full stomach for a drink and hangout since all our local bars are overcrowded.</p>
