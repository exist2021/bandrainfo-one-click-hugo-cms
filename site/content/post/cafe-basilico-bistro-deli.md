<p>Walk into this upbeat and friendly bistro which was the first of its kind in Bandra to offer fine world cuisine, all day, along with breakfast, coffees, teas and freshly made desserts and breads. You can choose to be seated in the open among lush green plants under lovely umbrellas, or the plush couches inside. Basilico Bandra has become popular with tourists and locals alike.</p>
