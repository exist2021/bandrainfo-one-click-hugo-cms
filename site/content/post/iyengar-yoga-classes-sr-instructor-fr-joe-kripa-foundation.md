<h2 id="3e32f">The Back Story of Fr. Joe and the Kripa family</h2>
<p>In 2006 when Kripa foundation celebrated its silver jubilee, Guruji BKS Iyengarat Rang Sharda gifted Fr. Joe and the Kripa family with the acknowledgement of <strong><a   href="http://Kripafoundation Iyengar YogaTM (KFIYTM)">Kripa foundation</a> Iyengar YogaTM (KFIYTM). </strong>Having seeing the way Fr.

<h2 id="co8qb">Bandra West Centre for Yoga Classes</h2>
<p>The new centre of Iyengar Yoga at KCA, Bandra West is a Golden opportunity for people of all ages and of all ailments to taste the healing touch of Guruji BKS Iyengar.  A set of people in recovery, alongwith Fr. Joe will lead this project in the spirit of Mother Theresa, sharing and caring not as professionals but as wounded healers in the likeness of Christ my Supreme Yogi.  Guruji too was a wounded healer, who overcame all the challenges of health from the time of his early childhood till the very end.  For Fr. Joe this was the unique strength of the teachings of Mother Theresa.  Just as Mother Theresa inspired us to reach out to the poorest of the poor, Guruji BKS Iyengarhas blessed Fr. Joe to reach out the poorest of the poor in health.  This new centre of Kripa foundation is open to all – <strong>three days in a week – Tuesday, Thursdays and Saturday from 7 to 8:30 pm and we inaugurate this beautiful gift of Guruji and Mother Theresa on workers day – 1st May 2019 at 5 pm.</strong></p>
<p>This centre will cater to people in need of Physical health, Psychological and Emotional health and above all Spiritual health.  Iyengar Yoga unfortunately has been marketed for its Bahiranga Sadhana, which means outer body work.  This is contrary to the original teaching of Iyengar.  One has to avoid making a fetish of body work. When Guruji practiced Asanas he emphasised the two characteristics of <strong>alignment and balance</strong>, this is possible by the Antaranga Sadhana which has two dimensions &#8211; Pranayama and Pratyahara. He did this is a scientific way bringing our practice to be an inward journey.  His teaching emphasized on making the practice a journey from the periphery to the centre; from the sympathetic nervous system to the central nervous system. It is because of this holistic practice, Guruji said that “our bodies are a temple of God’s spirit and therefore every Asanas for me becomes a prayer.</p>
