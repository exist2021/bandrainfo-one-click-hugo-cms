Yogācārasimply means “one whose practice is Yoga”, and their philosophy is about learning to live consciously and harmoniously in daily life.  What sets Yogācāra apart is their approach.  The experience begins with Dr. Ruchi, or a Wellness Consultant who takes the time to understand yourwellness and health challenges, lifestyle and needs.  Yogācāra then developsa wellness plan to suit your individual needs, and provides you theneeded support on a mental, physical and emotional level tohelp clients heal, and incorporate sustainable changes towards a happier, healthier and more balancedway of living.</p>
<p>“Our work at Yogācāra centers around helping our clients understand their physical bodies, and the nature of the mind through Yoga and Meditation, and also keeping the body pure, light and healthy through Ayurveda and Panchakarma treatments. We also look to create a better understanding of the foods we eat, given that some foods give us greater energy while the heaviness of certain foods deplete us. Hence, we support our clients to understand what works for them in totality, enabling them to make the right choices for themselves. The goal is to develop a deeper understanding of who we are by incorporating these wonderful practices into our daily lives, and by developing a deeper understanding of ourselves.”says Radhika Vachani, Founderof Yogācāra</p>

<p>Yogācāra continues to move forward in its efforts to build a magnificent Wellness Center that heals and inspires people to live more balanced and happier lives. The Yogācāra philosophy epitomizes an authentic and traditional approach toward healing and revitalization of one’s mind, body and essential energies, guided by pure and traditional physical and mental disciplines.  And thus, a very important element added to the wellness services at Yogācāra is the Ayurveda and Panchakarmasection, headed by Dr.RuchiUpadhyay MD, and on their panel of specialists, Dr. Uday and Dr. MadhuraKulkarni, respected and long time practitioners of Ayurveda and Panchkarma, and Founders of “Arogyadham”.</p>
<p>Ayurveda is an ancient Indian medical Sciencebased on the premise that the universe is made up of five elements: air, water, fire, earth and ether. These elements are represented in humans as three &#8220;doshas&#8221; or energies known as Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Ayurveda stresses a balance of these three elemental energies: Vayu/Vata (air and space-&#8220;wind&#8221;), pitta (fire &amp; water -&#8220;bile&#8221;), and Kapha (water &amp; earth-&#8220;phlegm&#8221;). When any of the doshas accumulate in the body beyond the desirable limit, the body loses its balance and disease manifests. Hence balancing these three doshas in our bodies becomes essential.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ayurveda and Yoga are lifestyle sciences that fully integrate with each other to provide sustainable solutions for wellness and health management.  Both sciences emphasize healthy living, and purification and rejuvenation of the mind, body and spirit, to achieve youthfulness, longevity and vitality, while also helping treat ailments and chronic diseases. Ayurveda incorporates plant based medicines and panchakarma treatments that work in harmony with nature, and that are all about creating balance in ourselves, and thus these sciences work perfectly with our philosophy at Yogācāra &#8220;, says DrRuchiUpadhyay.</p>
<p>At Yogācāra we focus on the branch of Ayurveda known as Kayachitikitsa-internal herbal and holistic medicine-which deals with the diagnosis, prevention, and the treatment of diseases; Panchakarma (five actions) which is the cleansing and rejuvenating program for the body, mind and consciousness; and Swasthavritta which deals with the science of good health and good living.</p>
<p>To conclude, Yogācāra’s members are essentially those who have chosen to embark on a path of a healthier, and a more balanced way of living; coming back to a natural state of connectedness in everything that they do. Each one imbibes the slow movement philosophy of retaining one’s health, energy and youthfulness through the incorporation of simple and harmonious rhythms back into their daily lives through the benefits of Yoga, Meditation, Ayurveda and Life Enhancement Workshops.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, Yogācāra’s key to success is the strong support and guidance that is offered to clients to implement necessary changes towards a happier and more balanced life, while living a normal existence.Yogācāra,considered to be one of the best and most effective Wellness Centers in Mumbai today, has had phenomenal successes working with their clients both with serious medical illnesses, and also general mind and body fitness. Theirclient testimonials speak volumes of their methodology used.</p>
<h3><b>SESSIONS AT YOGĀCĀRA</b></h3>
<p><b><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Yogacara.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-3887" alt="Yogacara" src="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Yogacara.jpg?resize=336%2C368&#038;ssl=1" width="336" height="368" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Yogacara.jpg?resize=934%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 934w, https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Yogacara.jpg?resize=273%2C300&amp;ssl=1 273w, https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Yogacara.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Yoga</b></p>
<p>In a city like Bombay, people commonly complain about back problems, stomach disorders, asthma, insomnia, and allergies and being stressed and exhausted, and wanting ways to relax, release stress, and to be fit and healthy.</p>
<p>Majority of asanas involve a static stretching of the muscles which brings about proper muscular tone. These asanas also increase the flexibility of the spine, make the back and spinal muscles stronger, and stimulate the vital organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities, which result in a more efficient, stronger and rejuvenated body.Through regular practice one not only learns to still the mind, but one learns to perform asanas effortlessly and to maintain the posture for a comfortable period of time. In a general fitness class, one would follow a well planned out sequence of postures that cover standing, sitting, twisting, forward, backward bends and inverted asanas to stimulate and rejuvenate the body in its entirety, while taking care not to overstress the body.</p>
<p><b>Pranayama&amp;Mediatation</b></p>
<p>Pranayama is the essential prerequisite for true meditation. In meditation, the mind is absolutely silent but razor sharp. However, most people find it difficult to achieve a state of stillness. Through Pranayama and control of the breath, one can still and relax the mind; when the breath becomes smooth and steady so does the mind. Only then, can one learn to withdraw the senses from external activity, &amp; cultivate a state where true relaxation and meditation is experienced, irrespective of the situation around us.</p>
<p><b>Energy Healing: Chakra &amp;Pranic</b></p>
<p>Both are a highly evolved and tested systems of energy healing that utilizes prana (life force) to balance, harmonize and transform the body&#8217;s energy processes, releasing blocked energy and emotions. It is based on the fundamental principle that the body is a self-repairing living entity, which has the ability to heal itself by cleansing and energizing the chakras, and increasing the body’s life-force. Chakra healing is very effective in healing mental, emotional issues, addictions and illnesses.</p>

<p>Her journey with yoga and wellness has largely been inspired by her own experience of having worked in a high stress, faced paced corporate environment as a professional, and her love foryoga that began in San Francisco in 1999, where she began avidly studying and practicing Iyengar yoga. Since her return to India in 2005, she has spent several years dedicated to learning the techniques of Yogacharya BKS Iyengar, one of the world’s foremost authorities on hatha yoga, and studying other ancient healing therapies.  This has resulted in Yogācāra’s balanced and wholesome approach to nurture the mind, body and spirit.</p>
