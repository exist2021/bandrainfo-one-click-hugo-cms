But music as a community activity and generation of new audiences for local talent remains a bit of challenge. ‘Live from The Console’ at Rowson&#8217;s Reserve Smooth Spaces is the answer to that challenge.</p>
<p>&#8216;Live from The Console&#8217;: is a coming together of fresh musical talent &amp; like-minded people. The idea is to give bands a new, alternative platform to showcase their music &amp; you to discover it! We’re hoping to see musicians, A&amp;R types, music biz types and hopefully YOU at the ‘The Console’- the idea being to create a no frills community of music lovers that gets together to discover new musical talent that goes beyond Sheela, Munni and Mutton.</p>
<p>Discover new music. Meet like minded people from the scene. If that&#8217;s not enough, booze at wallet friendly prices!</p>
