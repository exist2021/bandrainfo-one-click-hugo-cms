<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tbz2.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-5009 alignright" alt="tbz2" src="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tbz2.jpg?resize=300%2C297&#038;ssl=1" width="300" height="297" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tbz2.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tbz2.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The story of TBZ began in 1864, in a tin shed at Zaveri Bazar. Late Shri Bhimji Zaveri’s vision was to give India the jewellery it deserved, that of uncompromising quality and craftsmanship. This vision was furthered by his son, Late Shri Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri, who expanded the business by opening new showrooms. But it was his grandson, Late Shri Gopaldas Zaveri, who shook up the Indian market by offering customers a full value gold buy-back scheme.</p>
<p>This legacy of unapologetically putting the customer first still continues. Under the able guidance of Mr. Shrikant Zaveri, TBZ successfully transformed into the modern and innovative jewellery maker it is today.</p>
<p>We are now the jewellery destination of choice for every occasion, from a woman’s everyday wear to delicately crafted pieces for the biggest day of her life. Our path-breaking ways are also evident in retail. All our stores are staffed by highly trained personnel who ensure that every customer leaves a TBZ store completely satisfied.</p>
<p>Our presence in the Indian market has been marked by a number of firsts – the first to offer buy back guarantee on gold jewelry, the first to promote the concept of light weight jewelry and the first to offer certified solitaire diamonds. Thanks to these and many other instances of innovation and commitment to excellence, we are now one of India’s largest jewellery retailers.</p>
