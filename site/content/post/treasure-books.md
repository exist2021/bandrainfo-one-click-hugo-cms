<p>We at Treasure Books are keen to get children to enjoy books and reading at a young age. We conduct different activities at various reading levels to cater to all age groups. The Treasure Books Reading Program includes story-telling sessions for young children to be introduced to stories and books, READ.PLAY.ENJOY themed workshops and Reading Club for older children who can read on their own.</p>
<p><b>Read.Play.Enjoy</b> is a themed workshop where each session is structured to introduce a book through interactive story telling for younger kids and reading together for older kids. The contents of the stories come alive and are reinforced through vocabulary building word games and art and craft activities. To carry forward the reading experience, the children take home new books as part of the workshop.</p>

<p>At Treasure Books, the books are categorized to enable easy viewing and selection of books dedicated to different reading levels. We encourage our young patrons to read at their own pace, and not necessarily by their age or school grade. Our categories are broad guidelines for children to graduate to different reading material at a pace they are comfortable with. Each section is made distinct so that you know where to look for your infant and the older children know exactly where to find their favorite read!</p>
