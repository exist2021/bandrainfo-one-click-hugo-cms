All the good stuff including our famous Burmese Kaukswe and Tibetan Momos housed under a compact roof and with super quick service. Dine in or order out for take-aways or deliveries.</p>
<p>In the words of<strong> Nikhil Chib</strong>, chef and owner of Busaba and Busago &#8211;</p>
<p>[quote] The food is quick, healthy, tasty and most importantly at an affordable bang for buck price. The decor is clean, modern, simple with no frills. It’s like eating a scrumptious wholesome noodle soup on the soi&#8217;s of Bangkok without the plastic chairs and the roaches. The response has been overwhelming. The beautiful people (and there are many) strolling in. The families and then the just inquisitive passer bys have made it a crazy week. Crowds have been coming in to savour the juicy momos and seriously fiery house made chili sauces. The kaukswe is subtle and the right consistency and with the condiments, is real comfort food. There are the Thai curries which I have to say are very authentic and can give the mamas at Chatuchak weekend market in Bankgok a run for their money. The famous beef bulgogi melts in your mouth. There are some healthy concoctions of juices and smoothies, but no one can walk away without eating the classic lemon tart made to perfection or the gooey banofee pie.One big miss for us is the outstanding chocolate fondant that Busaba makes and we hope can come on to the menu. [/quote]</p>
