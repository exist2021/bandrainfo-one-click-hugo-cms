And no one does Linen fabrics better than us – LinenVogue la Classe.

<p>Highly breathable in nature, Linens are far better than cotton. They allow the heat to escape double than cotton and eighteen times faster than silk.This make them the cool fabric(by atleast 3 &#8211; 4⁰ C) that protects you from the summer sun.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Linen is the wear of the confident. It is apt for the summer wedding. Choose from amongst the shade of tan that will help you beat the heat and look dapper at the same time. Try contrasting the textures with pattern to accentuate your statement. For formals pull a Linen blazer over your shoulder to stay breezy and look business appropriate. Team up your blazer with chinos or jeans to make this your weekend style statement too. Linen shirts are an excellent wear for this sultry summer heat. They have a casual appeal to it. Choose from the classic shades of pastels and you are done for summer. If you seek for trousers it is better to choose from linen blends. Linen blends give a desired look to the trousers.
