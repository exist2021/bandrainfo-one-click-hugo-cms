It evolved into a middle school in 1943 and a full fledged high school in 1951, when its students appeared for the S.S.C. examination for the first time. Over the decades the school has not only grown structurally and numerically but also academically and in other areas as it celebrated its centenary in January 2010 when a new motto and badge were introduced.</p>
<p>The former motto <em><strong>‘Per Ardua ad Astra’</strong></em> (Latin) was translated as</p>
<p>[quote]‘Through Hard Work to the Stars’[/quote].</p>
<p>The spirit of the old motto is retained in the new one:[quote] ‘EXCELLENCE THROUGH ENDEAVOUR’[/quote]</p>
<p>St Aloysius High School, backed by the experience of a hundred years strives to encourage its students to reach greater heights, to reach the unreachable stars.</p>
