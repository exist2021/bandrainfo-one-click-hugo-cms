Approximately a year after opening the doors of Method Contemporary Art Space in Kala Ghoda, they have opened [Method, Contemporary Art & Treats](https://www.instagram.com/methodbandra/) in Bandra.While [Method's](https://themethod.in) first location in Kala Ghoda is mainly intended to display and experience art in multiple forms, the vision for Method has always been to relinquish the idea that art & the spaces that showcase it should have boundaries or guidelines.

The approach has always been fluid, ready to follow or build based on new interests and the movement of art. **Over the last year, Method has curated over 10 art exhibits and installations. They have had some great live music, experimental music streams and open mics**. On the sidelines and something which they don't talk about, they have assisted over 15 startups add art to their brand identity and visual story.

## Art with Music and Treats.

Method Bandra is not the next chapter for says Emma. It's simply an extension of the ongoing experiment that is Method. The location still has art at its core. Music will be a part of everything they do. But they are extending the experiment to include a range of Method treats - speciality coffee, bakes and other beverages.Until the lockdown started, they had no intention of opening a second location but this young, mad city of Bombay, has shown them, unconditional love, in their first year and we hope that continues with this new step forward.
