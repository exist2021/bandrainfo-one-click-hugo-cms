<p>Kinderland is geared towards offering an opportunity for children to discover their own gifts and talents and take charge of their own learning for their future. Kinderland believes that, the individual ability of every child is limitless. As human beings, we all arrive here with a survival kit; but we grow and develop within a process of constant interaction with our environment. It is this conducive environment that Kinderland promises to give our children, and we hope that you will make the most of it- both you as parents and your child.</p>
<p><b>Our Mission Statement :</b></p>
<p>Kinderland provides an environment that is designed to ignite in the children a thirst for learning. We are concerned with advancing education through the appropriate use of Information and Communication Technologies (i.e. IT). The child&#8217;s special needs, interests, strengths and weaknesses are tailored to and extended. To achieve this, the staff at Kinderland are closely monitored and assisted to impart quality education. No compromise will be made to develop the school to be at par with the best around. We plan to create an atmosphere where children can grow physically, morally, spiritually and intellectually.</p>
<p><b>Our Philosophy</b></p>
<p>Kinderland has a well developed 4 year programme designed to enhance your child&#8217;s social, emotional, cognitive, physical and academic growth to ready them for formal education.</p>
<p>We believe that it is the process rather than the product through which a child learns that is important.</p>
<p>We aim to open the world of learning</p>
<p>•             By developing their wonder and exciting their learning.</p>
<p>•             By addressing content area through themes.</p>
<p>•             By focussing intensively on language and literacy with emphasis on oral language.</p>
<p>•             By incorporating favourite classic children&#8217;s books, songs and poems to develop themes, skills and concepts.</p>
<p>•             By encouraging children to explore independently.</p>

<p><b>Numeracy Alive Program:</b></p>
<p>This enriching programme serves as a meaningful and concrete way for children to acquire early mathematical concepts through hands-on learning materials from the child&#8217;s own environment, game boards, work cards and worksheets.</p>
<p><b>Integrated Language Arts Program:</b></p>

<p><b>Technology Integrated Learning</b></p>

<p><b>Tai-Chi</b></p>
<p>An exercise to help children with motor development and concentration to help increase their attention span.</p>
<p><b>Water Play / Splashing Around</b></p>
<p>Children will be exposed to Water play and Sand play in troughs at the Pre-Nursery and Nursery levels. They will then be given the opportunity to get into a baby pool and splash around to build their confidence for swimming at a later stage.</p>
<p><b>Messy Play</b></p>
<p>Pottery, Play Dough and other sand materials to create their own imaginative articles are given to them to develop their gross and fine motor skills.</p>
<p><b>Music and Movement</b></p>
<p>In our teaching and exposure to music, the emphasis is always in enjoyment. The children are taught songs of all kinds and are exposed to a variety of instruments from time to time. By playing and listening to music we develop their listening skills and we also note their response to music. Everything that is movement to music will develop their senses.</p>
<p>[quote]Music gives wings to the mind, a soul to the universe, flight to the imagination and a life to everything[/quote]  -Plato</p>
<p><b>Art and Craft</b></p>
<p>Art is taught both as a means to support the curriculum areas and as a subject by itself. Children will be exposed to a variety of techniques and use various media. Art appreciations will be introduced by talks from some contemporary artists or visits to Museum and Art Galleries. Children learn a lot hands-on and therefore Craft activities will be a part and parcel of the school curriculum.</p>
<p><b>Drama</b></p>
<p>This is taught throughout the years of development to inculcate values and confidence in young minds. It helps in developing Language and expression skills.</p>
<p><b>Puppet Play</b></p>
<p>This exposes children to Language skills and promotes thinking skills and listening skills.</p>
<p><b>Field Trips</b></p>
<p>Children will be taken on field trips for exposure to their environment by letting it work as their learning tool.</p>
