Le15 ensures each pastry is stored in an ideal condition to maintain the quality of the immaculate dessert.</p>
<p>At Le15, quality is paramount and the drive for perfection was instilled in owner Pooja Dhingra&#8217;s psyche during her education at Switzerland&#8217;s prestigious hospitality management school, César Ritz. Having completed her undergraduate studies, Pooja embarked upon a year-long affaire de coeur with Paris&#8217; 15th Arrondissement, where she lived.</p>
<p>She acquired a diploma in Patisserie at the highly-regarded culinary school, Le Cordon Bleu, considered to be the guardian of French culinary technique since its inception in 1895. Pooja also gained valuable work-experience working with renowned French chocolatier Jean Charles Rochoux.</p>

Pooja&#8217;s macarons provide an array of flavours with multiples textures, with combinations such as the passion-fruit and chocolate, rose, etc. that have even French expats wowing.</p>
<p>While macarons are her signature pastry, she creates innovative cakes, cupcakes, éclairs, tarts and truffles using only select quality ingredients.</p>
