<p>The Baker’s Dozen, a chain of artisan bread shops with a central kitchen at Wadala and outlets in Prabhadevi and at Kemps Corner, opened its third outlet at Pali Naka, Bandra (West) recently.</p>
<p>It is the brainchild of Aditi Handa [who took a baking course at New York’s International Culinary Centre (formerly the French Culinary Institute)], her husband Sneh Jain and her brother Siddharth Handa [director, Mimansa Industries Pvt Ltd, which is also the parent company of Suasti Medical Centre at Sanpada (East), Navi Mumbai].</p>
<p>Jain said, “We started our Prabhadevi outlet almost a year ago, and this is our third. Our unique selling proposition is that all our bread is handmade (which is why they are not of a uniform size) and contains no fats, preservatives or chemicals. Most of them are made of wheat.”</p>
<p>“We use sourdough, and hence do not have to use yeast. As far as the amount of protein is concerned, a few slices of any kind of bread made at The Baker’s Dozen are equivalent to a bowl of dal (which is one of the main sources of protein for vegetarians).The Focaccia does not contain olive oil,” he added.</p>
<p>“We pack them in butter paper, and that is the material in which they must remain packed. This should be placed in a bread box to avoid drying,” Jain said. They must be used within two days of manufacturing and sliced only at the time of use.</p>
<p>An Indian variant available at The Baker’s Dozen is ragi bread (made of whole wheat flour, plain white wheat flour, ragi flour, salt, sugar, milk powder, butter and flour strengthener). Half a loaf (seven slices) is priced at Rs 25 and a loaf (comprising 13 slices) is priced at Rs 50 (both exclusive of taxes).</p>
<p>Ragi crackers – priced at Rs 50 (exclusive of taxes) – are made of whole wheat flour, plain white wheat flour, ragi flour, garlic, salt, sesame seeds and honey. They can be served with any dip.</p>
<p>Jain said, “One of the highlights is the sourdough pav, which is available in five variants [coriander, methia (a Gujarati variant), Malvani, wheat and bajra].” They would be sold in packs of six. While the coriander, methia and Malvani pavs are priced at Rs 40 each (exclusive of taxes), the latter are priced at Rs 30 each (exclusive of taxes).</p>
<p>Various French varieties of bread are available at the store. These include Brioche (made of plain white flour, milk, eggs, butter, sugar and salt, and are priced at Rs 110, exclusive of taxes); the range of sourdough pains (pain is the French word for bread), which comprises six variants – Pain aux cereals; Pain au levain [which is available in three variants (namely with walnuts and raisins; with apricots and cherries and with blueberries and cranberries)], and the two sliced variants (Pain complet and Pain complet multi-grain); sourdough dinner rolls; sourdough baguettes; croissants and pain au chocolat.</p>
<p>Pain aux cereals is made of whole wheat flour, plain white wheat flour, salt, sesame seeds and flax seeds, and priced at Rs 110, exclusive of taxes.</p>
<p>Besides the respective combination of fruit, dry fruit or nuts, the pain au levain variants have three ingredients in common (whole wheat flour, plain white wheat flour and salt). The walnut and raisin variant is priced at Rs 180; the apricot and cherry variant is priced at Rs 120, and the blueberry and cranberry variant is priced at Rs 200 (all of which are exclusive of taxes.)</p>
<p>Half a loaf of pain complet comprises seven slices (priced at Rs 25), and a loaf of pain complet comprises 13 slices (priced at Rs 50, both exclusive of taxes). They are made of whole wheat flour, plain white wheat flour, milk powder, salt, sugar and flour strengthener.</p>
<p>Half a loaf of pain complet multi-grain comprises seven slices (priced at Rs 40), and a loaf of pain complet multi-grain comprises 13 slices (priced at Rs 80, both exclusive of taxes). They contain whole wheat flour, plain white wheat flour, milk powder, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, flax seeds, salt, sugar and flour strengthener.</p>
<p>The sourdough dinner rolls are priced at Rs 40 (exclusive of taxes). These are available in packs of three, and are assorted. The sourdough baguettes are priced at Rs 100 (exclusive of taxes), and are made of whole wheat flour, plain white wheat flour and salt. The croissants are priced at Rs 70 (exclusive of taxes), and are made of plain white wheat flour, milk, salt and sugar.</p>
<p>The pain au chocolat is priced at Rs 90 (exclusive of taxes), and is made of plain white wheat flour, milk, salt, yeast, chocolate and sugar. The latter variants are non-vegetarian (as is Brioche).</p>
