<p>Born and brought up in Mumbai, Anurag went on to study Fashion and Design at the London College of Fashion, where he refined his expertise acquired in India and expanded and honed his creativity.</p>
<p>His intricate and inventive approach to design resulted in an impressive portfolio of work that earned him the opportunity to work with the notorious British design house Alexander McQueen and subversively quirky London label the Rodnik Band amongst others.</p>
<p>Having worked for internationally acclaimed Indian couturier duo Abu Jani &#8211; Sandeep Khosla, Anurag developed an in-depth appreciation for fantastical embellishments and the true glory of Indian textiles, embroideries and patterns which now take shape into classic garments with a forward looking modernistic edge for the understated yet unapologetic glamazon, under his vision.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">ANURAG VORA’s debut collection was launched along with his flagship store in Bandra, Mumbai in 2013.</span></p>
