<p dir="auto">Yesterday on my walk on Bandstand, I chanced upon this vegan ice cream truck called Scoopalicious opposite this nursing home (whose sisters were apparently not very happy that the truck right opposite their gate) on BJ Road.</p>
<p>So I have been hearing about the Bombay Food Truck Company and have always wondered where can I find them. The truck is a tempo; the design is quite sad and not so sick as you can see from the pictures I took last night. </p>
<p>But before we rule them out, what I loved about this ice cream truck is that they had ice creams in some unique flavours like dates &amp; jaggery. Unfortunately, most of the flavours on the menu were out of stock, so I settled for a rose petal ice cream. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The ice cream will cost your Rs 50 if you have it in a cup and Rs 60 if you are a cone person. Just beware, since this is a shop on wheels, they might be shifting their location along the bandstand promenade, but nevertheless keep a watch if you fancy a nut milk based icecream.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As per @itsmumbaifoodie a popular food handle the truck location is as below. </p>

<blockquote><p>The customised flavours have 100 per cent pulp, and are organic and blended with natural flavours; there are no preservatives. Look out for flavours like Mango Chilli, Dark chocolate cookie, Mocha Bourbon Boondie, Ripe coconut Modak, Jaggery and Dates.<br /><cite> &#8211; via <a href="https://www.mid-day.com/articles/bandra-ice-cream-truck-scoopalicious-bombay-food-truck-company-mumbai-food/17612186">mid-day</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">They are exclusively selling 100 per cent organic ice-creams with flavours like ginger cinammon {which they claim is the absolute best} , boondi, gulab jamun, jackfruit, raw mango, coconut, double chocolate, gulkand, among a few others. We are loving the sound of chili mango. The said chili used is being brought in from Manipur, and all their ice-creams will be made using the natural pulp of ingredients.</p>
