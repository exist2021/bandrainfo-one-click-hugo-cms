<p>Armed with passion for artistic excellence and prompted by flair for eclectic designs, Shruti Bhandari has carved a niche of her own in the world of fashion.</p>
<p>Hailing from a lineage of generations involved in manufacturing of fabrics and other creative pursuits, she has always had an artistic bent of mind. From a very early age she knew she wanted to be a designer and decided to branch out and do this on her own.</p>
<p>She holds a degree in Fashion Technology and has designed, under the able tutelage of Sameer Patel for around 7 years, for various celebrities, TV Shows like Indian idol, Nach Baliye etc.</p>
<p>Shruti launched her own Label <strong><em>Shruti Bhandari</em> </strong> in 2010. The label has its Flagship store on Waterfield Road (Bandra) and also retails at Amara (kemps corner), Fuel ( Chowpatty) . Her collection is also displayed online on Indianroots.</p>
<p>Her Inspiration is drawn from varied sources and artisan techniques. The label is best known for its exquisitely classic yet stylish and timeless designs.</p>
<p>The collection ranges from Exquisite Indian ethnic wear, Bridals, Trousseau, Gowns, Fashion garments and Tunics for Women to Sherwanis, Jodhpuries and Kurtas for Men.</p>
<p>Shruti Bhandari’s latest Danka Collection seeks to make the crafts of the Rajasthan region commercially viable The exquisite technique of heritage craftsmanship has existed some 400 years back and is almost on its way of fading out due to lack of awareness and appreciation. She was sensitive to the fact that it is going to become a dying art soon, since the younger generations of the artisans are not taking a keen interest in it due to lack of monetary appreciation. With her initiative of projecting the exquisite beauty and craftsmanship through her collection she wishes to create awareness and appreciation.</p>
