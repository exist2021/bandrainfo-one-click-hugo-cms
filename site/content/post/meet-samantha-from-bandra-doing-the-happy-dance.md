<p class="p1">I follow Samantha on Instagram, she recently tagged me on this video and I thought it was a great gesture from Samantha of thinking of doing something different with all the graffiti art. She has used dance and the hit song by Pharell Williams in this fun one minutes video. So I decided to ask her 5 questions.</p>
