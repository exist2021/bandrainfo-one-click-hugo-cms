<p>In keeping with the theme of developing the 16th road a new building called Corner View has come up. It houses some new shops like Karachi Bakery, a vegetarian departmental store called Foodiez, a pizza place, a milkshake outlet etc.</p>

<p>I have always been sceptical on the intention of the governments pro-development policies. Development is a good word, but who reaps the rewards of the development initiatives is always a murky and hidden. MLA Mr. Shelar being the earnest party worker has been going after pursuing the goals of development with all his might. He has expressed his vision of turning 16th Road into a posh khau galli.</p>
<h2 id="32emr">Corner View Building at 15th Road has installed &#8220;anti-poor&#8221; spikes</h2>
<p>Appeal to Corner view management to remove the anti-poor spikes. This is not good culture and not welcoming architecture. Bandra could do without these negative signals.</p>

<h3 id="8jecg"><strong>Delivery Boys, Handy Men we don’t want you to hanging out</strong></h3>
<p>We want service on the app. Carpenters, delivery boys are zipping through the suburbs. But when we see them hanging out in groups, we feel insecure. These people servicing the tony bandraites are often residing in distant suburbs of Virar. When they sit on their bikes we have a problem.</p>
<h2 id="eusih"><strong>Unfriendly for kids and elderly</strong></h2>
<p>These spikes can seriously hurt children or elderly who might trip and fall over it. Residents have raised concern over the installation of these spike the Corner View society.</p>
