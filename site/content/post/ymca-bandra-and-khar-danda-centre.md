<p>The Young Men’s Christian Association in India seeks to unite men, women, youth and children as co-workers with God to promote mutually caring and loving human communities. It strives for a just society where oppression, exploitation and denial of life will be confronted and abolished. It believes in the sanctity of life and preservation of all creation. It stands for renewal and reconciliation in a broken world.</p>
<p>The Bandra branch, established in 1992, has grown by leaps and bounds. Favoured by pleasing surroundings and a diverse community, the Bandra branch has become a landmark of sorts, with members coming from far and wide. Added activities over the years have made the branch complete in many ways. It was only on September 30, 1993, that the Board took the decision to make Khar Danda Centre the venue for the Bandra branch.</p>
<p><b>Khar Danda Centre</b></p>
<p>The work of the <b>Khar Danda Centre</b> shows the social activities of the Bombay YMCA at the most basic level. Through the Centre, and its programmes, it supports the upliftment of the residents of the seven slums surrounding the Centre. The effort to bring these people to the mainstream of society, is an ongoing process.</p>
<p>The <strong>Balwadi</strong><strong> at Khar Danda Centre</strong><b> </b>prepares preschool children for schooling. YMCA’s low cost Balwadis have been the reason for many, specially the poor in the community, to pursue and complete their education. The <strong>Outreach &amp; Development Department</strong> conducts Balwadis in several areas of the city using the facilities of the Municipal Schools in these areas.<b> </b></p>
