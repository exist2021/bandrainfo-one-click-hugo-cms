<p>Your little child has grown beyond your lap and now learnt to walk. We at KID’S CONCEPT are waiting to welcome your little one with open arms. We well understand your anxiety to give the best to your child and so here are a few tips to help you know us better.</p>
<p>From birth to 6 years are a child’s formative years, and experiences in these years is what he carries with him for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>To gently wean a child away from the protective circle of parents a playschool plays an important role. Here, using free play method, a child is introduced to carious concepts which later form the basis for their higher education, besides generating an interest and curiosity in their minds.</p>

<p>The development of motor skills, Social skills and Imaginative thinking are the most important steppingstones in the child’s early life. Nature study, lots of colours –play, messing with dough go a long way in helping the child explore.</p>
<p>Audio-Visuals form a very important part of education today and so we at KID’S CONCEPT have not only kept the above in mind but have incorporated the use of music, Projection and computers to compliment and enhance our concepts.</p>
<p>Easy access of books to flip through; help develop the love for reading in our young ones. We have various colourful encyclopedias besides Time Life and other many more wonderful titles.</p>
<p>To ensure physical development, we indulge our kids in weekly dance and yoga classes and an E.M.E program “for Nursery”</p>
<p>There is also a very enthusiastic Annual Day, Farm Day and Sports Day during the academic year which help the child to develop culturally and socially.</p>
<p>And finally to put young parents at ease we do like to inform you that we follow the traditional method during the settling period and so we request them to co-operate for the same.</p>
