<p>The <b>Maharashtra Mitra Mandal (MCubed) Library</b> was set up as a people&#8217;s initiative.</p>
<p>An appeal sent out to friends and family, was like an idea tossed into the community: it fired the imagination of people in the city, in the country and across continents, friends of books all. People contributed abundantly&#8230; money, furniture, computers, a projector and DVD player, and Books &#8211; Old, used and new.</p>
<p>It was overwhelming, especially because some of those who gave were not from this city or this country and would never personally benefit from this largesse.</p>
<p>Started uniquely for children, MCubed is now a full-fledged library for adults and children.</p>
<p>Set up as a library uniquely for children, it now has a large, completely separate section for grownups. With over 10,000 books and magazines in English, Hindi and Marathi, it is a book lover&#8217;s paradise.</p>
<p>Truly a Public Library &#8211; it welcomes members, regardless of circumstances and economic background. Everybody has equal access to the magic of books.</p>
<p><b>Membership options:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Annual Membership</li>
<li>Half Yearly Membership</li>
<li>Reading room membership</li>
<li>Gift a membership</li>
</ul>
<p>Children from modest backgrounds become members free of charge. They have access to everything the library offers, from books to workshops.</p>
