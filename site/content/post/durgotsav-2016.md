<p dir="auto">If you ask my about my favourite festival, it is not Ganesh Chaturthi or Diwali; it is the Durga Puja. Other festivals are have become more for the masses, and the only festival which is a bit posh is the Bengali Festival of Durga Puja.</p>
<p>When I first went to a Durga Puja, I was shocked to find all kind of non-veg dishes in the festival, my exposure till then was mostly to temples in Maharashtra and Karnataka. So if you are from South India and never been to a Durga Puja, you have been warned.</p>
<p>Also, I love the concept of Bhog, it a community meal available to all devotees who don&#8217;t mind to the serpentine Q, but let me tell you, its worth the wait.</p>
<p>We have 2 Durga Puja in the neighbourhood, one in Khar at Ram Krishna Mission and the other in Bandra at Patwardhan Park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>About Ramkrishna Mission Durga Puja Khar  </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Ramkrishna Mission in Khar&nbsp;is Famous for its&nbsp;traditional Kumari Puja&nbsp;in which an eight year old girl is decorated as Goddess Durga on&nbsp;Durga Asthami&nbsp;and seated on a thrown and worshipped by the crowd with flowers. You can go to this place for its authentic bhog served in the afternoon. It is located in&nbsp;Ramakrishna Mission Marg in Khar.<br /><cite> &#8211; via <a href="__GHOST_URL__/famous-durga-puja-pandals-in-and-around-bandra/">BANDRA INFO</a></cite></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Natunpalli Sarbojonin Durgotsav is celebrating its 39th Durga Puja near National College. “In the 1970s, top artistes from the Hindi film industry, including Hemant Kumar, Kishore Kumar, Shakti Samanta, R D Burman,&nbsp;Asha Bhosle, Salil Chowdhury, Jaya and&nbsp;Amitabh Bachchan&nbsp;and Raakhee, patronized the puja,” says spokesperson M C Banerjee. “Those glorious days will never return but we adhere to our original theme of national integration to this day. Visitors say the pandal gives them the feeling of having come home to Bengal.”</p>
