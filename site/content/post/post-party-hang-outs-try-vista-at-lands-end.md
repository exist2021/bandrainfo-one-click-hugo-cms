I usually love to hang out at the ground floor where they play my favourite retro music. It was a Saturday night &amp; packed &amp; some hectic dancing later, was really dehydrated &amp; while I asked two waiters for some Cranberry juice it never did make an appearance. Once the music shut, the bar closes too so we headed out &amp; I was super thirsty.</p>
<p>Discovered an entrepreneurial storekeeper has a tiny stall stocked with water, red bull, coke &amp; pepsi cans etc just a stone’s throw away from Shack. Got myself some cold water from him &amp; then we decided to head to Land’s End to hang out for a bit at Vista their 24 hour coffee shop. Unfortunately, their brilliant sea view was covered due to the rains or the dark (not sure which) but they served up a refreshing mocktail called the Berry Blast (strawberry, blueberry, rasberry slush style) &amp; was a great place to sit &amp; chat.</p>

<p>Even better, Bandstand was open for business with tons of people enjoying the sea breeze and the magestic waves at 3 am so we sat there and watched the sea. I dont think I will ever get tired of watching the sea!</p>
