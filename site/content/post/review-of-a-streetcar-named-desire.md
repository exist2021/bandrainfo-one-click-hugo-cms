<p dir="auto"><strong>By Manju Sampat</strong></p>
<p>Jeff Goldberg Studio’s latest offering, A Streetcar Named Desire, is<br />based on the classic play of the same name, by Tennessee Williams. The<br />original play, set in the sultry French Quarter of New Orleans, was made<br />into a powerful film in 1953. Three of the actors from this film won<br />Oscar awards and Marlon Brando as Stanley became a cult hero!</p>
<p>Goldberg, the director of this play, refers to his production as a<br />“Bombay Adaptation“. While the original play that won Williams a<br />Pulitzer prize was written in 1947, Goldberg has set his adaptation in<br />the late sixties in Bombay’s Chembur area. Instead of a streetcar, the<br />eponymous Bombay local train can be heard in the background. It is by<br />one such train, that Blanche DuBois, the play’s protagonist, arrives at<br />her sister Stella Fernandez’s house. This renowned drama follows<br />troubled former schoolteacher Blanche DuBois as she leaves Pondicherry<br />and moves in with her sister, Stella and her husband, Stanley, in<br />Bombay.</p>
<p>It is a long and difficult play to watch and be a part of, and the<br />cloying and stifling nature of some of the relationships unfolding on<br />stage, together with the constant reminder by Blanche, of the humid and<br />muggy pre-monsoon Bombay weather, make this a “claustrophobic” watch,<br />just what the author intended! Had the original script unfolded on<br />stage, the viewing would have been a bit tedious but because of a clever<br />adaptation and an easy flow between the Hindi and English dialogues in<br />this play, fewer demands are made on the audience and this adds to the<br />enjoyment of the play.</p>
<p>Blanche fancies herself as a bit of an aristocrat and is horrified to<br />see what a run down apartment her sister lives in. She claims that she<br />“lost” their beautiful home Belle Reve in Pondicherry as she needed the<br />money to look after their ailing parents. Now that they are no longer<br />alive, she has no one else in the world but Stella, who happily takes<br />her in. However, Blanche&#8217;s flirtatious presence causes problems for<br />Stella and Stanley, who already have a volatile relationship, leading to<br />an even greater conflict in the Fernandez household. Despite the fact<br />that she first finds Stanley “common” and is sickened by his uncouth<br />ways, she is strangely attracted by his animal magnetism. Stanley is<br />selfish and raucous, most inconsiderate of his pregnant wife Stella, and<br />only interested in drinking and playing cards with his equally uncouth<br />buddies. These encounters with his friends are a very interesting and<br />entertaining watch, and these encounters are invariably in Hindi and<br />also in Haryanvi as Stanley ‘s best friend Vir is from Haryana. His<br />other pals are Ajay, their landlord, who lives upstairs of Stella and<br />Stanley, and also Vijay, Ajay’s younger brother.</p>
<p>Stella and Ajay seem to have the only “straight” roles in the play.<br />Urvazi Kotwal as Stella and Rishabh Mehrotra as Ajay are both very<br />convincing in their parts and seem to be the only voices of reason, in<br />the midst of all the chaos.</p>
<p>Stanley is constantly rough and violent, especially with his wife, and<br />Kashyap Shangari manages to instil enough energy in his acting to play a<br />reasonable Stanley.</p>
<p>He is never quite convinced about all that Blanche makes herself out to<br />be. He realises she is totally delusional and not quite the cultured<br />lady she imagines she is. On probing, he finds many skeletons slipping<br />out of her cupboard. He wants Stella to send her away, but where is<br />Blanche to go. She makes a last desperate attempt to ensnare Vir, in the<br />hope he will marry her, but Stanley snatches even that refuge away from<br />Blanche. In her confession to Vir, more shocking and heartbreaking<br />secrets are exposed. Sumit Jakhar is brilliant as Vir, and his attempts<br />at communicating with the sophisticated Blanche in broken English, is<br />really quite touching. Saloni Khanna as Blanche, manages to convey her<br />vulnerability and does a commendable job of a difficult role, one that<br />needs to portray a false sense of grandeur.</p>
<p>The old Hindi film songs played in the background when the Hindi<br />speaking gang is playing cards and the haunting Edith Piaf riff when<br />Blanche is reminiscing about her past, are an effective tool to convey<br />an authentic atmosphere. The experiment of doing a substantial part of<br />the play in Hindi, works wonderfully well. There is a slight twist in<br />the end in this production. When Stella goes to hospital because of<br />premature labor, we see Stanley and Blanche alone in the house and they<br />go into the bedroom together, and the rest is left to our imagination.<br />Whereas in the film, Blanche is led away to an institution by a doctor<br />and she grandly says “I have always depended on the kindness of<br />strangers “</p>

<p>The night we saw this play, the real Mumbai monsoon actually arrived to<br />herald a new beginning and an end to the clammy and sultry atmosphere we<br />had been subjected to, for over two hours of viewing an excellent<br />production.!</p>
