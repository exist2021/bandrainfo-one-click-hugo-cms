<p>Khar Gymkhana is located in a well-known suburb of Bombay &#8211; Pali Hill.</p>
<p>Khar was a nascent sleepy suburb before the Independence when a few residents had formed a small association and were thinking of creating an outlet offering recreational facilities to the residents. At one such meetings in 1928 it was the casting vote of the chairman, which favoured the formation of Khar Gymkhana which would be accessible to the Middle Income group people. Initially a small room was made available at the Bungalow, at the corner of the 14th Road, and the C.D. Marg, which is presently known as Jain Arcade.</p>
<p>Around this time a Cricket Club known as Khar Young Cricketers led by the Late Mr. Vithaldas Divecha decided to merge with the Khar Gymkhana.</p>
