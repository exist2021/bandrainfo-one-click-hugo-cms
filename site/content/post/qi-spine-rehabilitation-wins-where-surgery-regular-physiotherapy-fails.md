<p dir="auto">Back pain has always been amongst the most challenging chronic pain conditions to treat globally. Published medical studies over the last 10 years have concluded that painkillers, surgery and even regular physiotherapy have failed to cure this problem that affects 8 out of 10 people during their lifetime. If you suffer from frequent or severe back pain, understanding your spine is the first step to recovery. Watch this video to understand the cause of back pain.</p>
