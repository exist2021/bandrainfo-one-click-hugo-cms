<p>The coffee shops business has seen a lot of consolidation happening and now is primarily reduced to two major players like Cafe Coffee day and Starbucks. All new cafes have decided to enter the marketplace via the domestic Tea route.</p>
<p>Tea villa is the 3rd entrant into this space in Bandra, after the super premium Taj Tea House at Reclamation, followed by the seemingly affordable Chaayos.</p>
<p>Tea villa at Hill Road is a well-designed place and quite spacious, this is their second outlet in Mumbai after the one in Vile-Parle. However the management is not up to the mark, the toilet was a bit soiled, and sugar tray was unkempt and dirty. The brand seems to be positioned to target young college going teens, as the music played was mainly Pop. They could be in competition with CCD&#8217;s regarding their brand positioning and pricing of their products. But unlike CCD, the place has a working kitchen and serves waffles and other breakfast and fast food snacks.</p>
<p>I had lost my appetite looking at the soiled sugar tray and decided I will stick to the tea; I ordered the Tea Villa Special tea which is a mix of 4/5 herbs and was not disappointed.</p>
<p>Overall I liked the place, its a nice upgrade to a CCD, which has unappetising food on display, but if &#8220;Tea villa cafe&#8221; doesn&#8217;t work on their housekeeping, it would always be a critical issue with me always.</p>
<p>Tea Villa Cafe is bang opposite Globus! Check it out and let me know about your experiences below.</p>
