But it&#8217;s not just about crepes: we are also offering Croques, Suzette&#8217;s signature hot sandwich, healthy salads made of quality and fresh ingredients, a large selection of natural juices, our original SmooZies, fine French teas and of course anything you like from our espresso bar.</p>
<p>Crepes are a centuries-old traditional recipe and certainly one of the most popular delicacy in France.</p>
<p>They come from Brittany, a wild land full of light and grace, in the North West of France.</p>
<p>Crepes Suzette were created in 1896 at the Cafe de Paris by the French Chef Henri Charpentier for King Edward VII. They were given the name of the King&#8217;s beautiful and mysterious Parisian « fiancée », Suzette, as a tribute to Beauty.</p>
<p>Our crepes are all made of the finest organic flours.</p>
<p>Suzette is considered as the Queen of Crepes.</p>
