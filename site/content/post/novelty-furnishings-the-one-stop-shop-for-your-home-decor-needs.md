<p>Novelty Furnishings began the delightful relationship with its customers way back in 1976 when the first showroom was inaugurated in the prime location of Bandra, Mumbai. Since then Novelty Furnishings has been a complete solution for those aspiring excellent quality and style in home furnishings. After an overwhelming response from our loyal customers, we were heartily inspired to open a new outlet at Vile Parle in 1992, which offered an exclusive collection of marbles and granites imported from various countries like Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Norway, Iran etc. And soon thereafter, in 2002, another outlet at Malad was opened which now offers an fascinating range in linens and furnishings.</p>
