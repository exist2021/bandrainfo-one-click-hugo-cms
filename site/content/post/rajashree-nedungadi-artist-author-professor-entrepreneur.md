<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Being in the industry for long, Ms. Rajashree realized that different professions face different challenges. CWE provides a manifesto for women entrepreneurs, ONE WOMAN &#8211; ONE PROFESSION, the networking mantra &#8211; the unique selling proposition. Given this, generic challenges faced by the members are sorted to the highest since each one comes with their own set of experiences and solutions. Additionally CWE will witness prominent speakers addressing our members for their own advantage. Potential members can attend the meeting as a guest to get a better idea about the initiative. Membership opens in April. </span></p>
