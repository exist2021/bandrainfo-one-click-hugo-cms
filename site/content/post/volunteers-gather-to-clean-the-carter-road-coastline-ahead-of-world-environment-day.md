<p dir="auto">Ahead of World Environment Day, volunteers gathered to clean the carter road coastline. Anya Rangaswamy who is leading the initiative and has created a <a href="httpss://www.facebook.com/pg/carterroadcleanup" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a> hopes this Sunday clean would become a weekly event for people who care for the city. They are supported by BWRA (the Bandra Residents Association) as well as the Solid Waste Management section of the BMC. </p>
<p dir="auto">The chachak Bandra team had also done a clean up yesterday. </p>
<p dir="auto"><em>I am wondering if the sea is continiously going to throw up garbage on the shore front, How long and how much would the clean up be effective. Nevetheless the efforts are appreciated. If Versova can do it, Bandra can do it too. </em></p>
