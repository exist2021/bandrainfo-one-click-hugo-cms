<p dir="auto"><strong>By Manju Sampat</strong>This weekend Bombay audiences were regaled to the delightful cover act, Platinum, The Live ABBA Tribute Show, at St. Andrews auditorium. This group, led by Andy Nye from London, was started in 1997. This six member band has been brought to India by Raell Padamsee and her Ace Media Productions and they were here courtesy Raell two years ago as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">Their two shows at St. Andrews were both house full performances. Andy Nye on the keyboard, impersonated and sang as Benny, ABBA’s leader, while his wife Sarah Jane sang as Anni Frid. Rob Hendry on the guitar enacted Bjorn and the fourth singer played Agnetha. They were also joined on stage by a bassist and a drummer.</p>
<p dir="auto">Andy has quite a sense of humour and he ensured that the Bandra audience had a rollicking party! As they listened to some familiar ABBA hits like ‘Mama Mia’, “Gimme, Gimme”, and “Money Money”, many from the audience got up to dance in the aisles, while others sang along with the band, making this a most interactive performance! Other popular songs that ensured that everyone had a gala time, were ‘Dancing Queen’, ‘Voulez Vous’, and the lyrical ‘Fernando’.</p>
<p dir="auto">It was heartening to see eight young girls from an NGO that Raell Padamsee supports in honour of her mother Pearl, also join the band on stage to sing the lovely song ‘Thank you for the Music’, with them. They also had a select number of people from the audience, who were competition winners, join them on stage to sing ‘I have a Dream’.</p>
<p dir="auto">The four lead singers of this band, did a great job impersonating the original four ABBA lead singers, and they looked the part as well, in their white satins and seventies style bell bottoms! The great thing about this band is that they do not lip sync but actually all sing live on stage. Also their choreography is spot on! Of course an encore was in order, and the band did not disappoint as they belted out the ever popular ‘Waterloo’!Their third performance at the NCPA <a href="http://airmail.calendar/2017-12-12%2012:00:00%20IST">on December 12th</a>, I am sure would have been equally entertaining.</p>
