<p>Ok, at the onset there is a confusion if the brand is &#8220;biryani by air&#8221; or &#8220;food by air&#8221;. But never mind let&#8217;s get to the Biryani.</p>
<p>Bandra is going through a Biryani crisis, since Arsalan which was known for it&#8217;s mildly flavoured Dum Biryani shut down due to rising rents and Golconda Bowl moved to much cheaper andheri/juhu.</p>
<p>Here comes the flamboyant Food (Biryani by Air) who promises to deliver authentic Hyderabadi Biryani experience by flying in your biryani straight from Hyderabad (in original packaging with 100 % pure meat certified label) within 7 hours ready to be served at your table hot. Isn&#8217;t that a marketing coup?</p>
<p>I mean can we impress our better halves or friends by saying we flew in a Hyderabadi biryani just for the occasion?</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20140318-151128.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" alt="20140318-151128.jpg" src="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20140318-151128.jpg?resize=230%2C230&#038;ssl=1" width="230" height="230" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I ordered the Shah Ghouse (SG) mutton biryani (Rs 475) which came in a huge silver foiled pack. The quantity was ample though I ate all the mutton pieces which were well done and flavourful on <strong>day one</strong> and I am eating the rice for last 2 days. Don&#8217;t understand the logic behind so much rice, but yeah it can last for days, break a egg, or add some potatoes and put it in the oven and it can make a good second and third meal. <strong>If you have hungry kids at home this is a good deal I think. </strong></p>
<p>Ordering was a bit buggy when my call was not answered the first day and second day they ran out of stock. (They usually run out of stock by 5pm). Third day I was lucky.</p>
<p>This is only a weekend service and you can <a href="https://foodbyair.myshopify.com/collections/biryanibyair-mumbai">book online</a>.</p>
