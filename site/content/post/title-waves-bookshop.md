<p>Titles Waves is Mumbai’s first boutique bookstore that boasts of a 40 feet wide grand entrance and spread over 8000 square feet. The ambience is warm spacious and customer friendly with innovative signage’s that will guide you to your favorite genre at a single glance. If this is not enough, then a touch screen kiosk with a customer interface can come to your rescue. Simply search by author, by title or by publisher and the exact location of your book jumps out.</p>
<p>The store has an equally huge collection of CD’s and DVD’s that are exclusively selected after tons of research and customer feedback.</p>
<p>But what makes this store unique is that a specially designed listening lounge has been created to belt out your favorite music and screen some high definition blue ray movie trailers on high definition LED panels. The setting is complete with coffee tables in the lower level of the store and will be launched soon. Adjacent to the lounge is an event area for workshops, author readouts and open mike nights. However the centre of the store on the main level has been left completely open to make space for selected premium events.</p>

<p>Essentially this store will be the most happening and interactive store in Mumbai which will feature multiple workshops on architecture, cookery, baking and for that matter even dance. Professional choreographers will be roped in to teach quick basic steps that individuals can pick up in 30 minutes. Guitar classes and writing workshops will also be conducted from time to time.</p>
<p>Just visit the store once, and you will see the difference.</p>
