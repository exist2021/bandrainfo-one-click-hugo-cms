<blockquote><p>More than a 1,000 passengers travel using BEST buses from Bandra east to west on a daily basis, yet, there is barely any connectivity or availability of buses for them. Bus 215, the only BEST bus, that runs taking the longest route from Bandra Reclamation in the west to Tata Colony in the east, has poor frequency and is plagued by delays.<br /><cite> &#8211; via <a href="https://www.mid-day.com/articles/mumbai-bandra-east-west-bus-no-215-best-longest-route-poor-frequency-delays/17626194">mid-day</a></cite></p></blockquote>
