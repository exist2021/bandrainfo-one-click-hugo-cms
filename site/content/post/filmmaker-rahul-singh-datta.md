Someone recommended me Rahul's [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/starvingartistfilms/) when I was looking for artists based in Bandra to interview. It is always interesting to know the perspective of someone who is not from this place. Rahul Singh Datta is from the lovely city of Chandigarh. He kindly agreed to answer my questions. He lets his expression out in the films he makes, so check out his [website](http://www.starvingartistfilms.com/) and [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/starvingartistfilms/) channel to learn more about this work.
