<p>Does the thought of crispy nachos dunked in melted cheese have you weak in the knees? Do fajita cravings keep you up all night? Or are you searching high and low for that perfect salsa sauce?</p>
<p>If any (or all!) of the above apply, Sancho&#8217;s is where you need to be. Make your way to the Salsa bar, the first of its kind in India, to sample a variety of gourmet Nachos teamed with your choice of Salsa – anything from a mild Verde to a fiery Habanero or Pico! Dig into prawn burritos that are as good looking as they are tasty, or find your favourite Enchilada – all served on the traditional Mexican wooden platter. Or, head straight to the bar and try drinking a full serving of our monster sized Margaritas and Daiquiries. For the experienced lot, there&#8217;s always Tequila!</p>
