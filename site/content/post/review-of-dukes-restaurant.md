# Dukes Restaurant

While strolling down the unending warren of by-lanes through Bandra, one would come upon Dukes Restaurant on Chapel Road. This quaint little eatery was started in the **27th year of the 20th century by Ahmed Haji TK.** Hailing from the beach village of Kasargod in Kerala, he migrated with a few members of his family, bringing along with them their native culture and delicious cuisine.

Currently being run by Farooq, Ashraf, Usman, Amir, Robert, Liyaket, Mangroo, Sonu, Faltan and Sharma; who work the sundry of roles, viz. waiting tables, cooking food, delivering food, manning the cash counter, etc. that need to be performed to keep the place functioning at its clockwork efficiency. Being a local who grew up near Dukes, I've satiated many of my hunger pangs by gorging upon mundanely named food that has a wholly refined and heavenly taste.

## Ricâ€™s Top Favorite - Buffalo Kheema

I shall start with my all-time favourite(hands down, no competition) buffalo kheema/mince. Made with multifarious ingredients of which the only ones that I was able to discern on my own are: peas, bay leaf, spices, green chillies, onions. This wholesome dish comes in three types, viz: kheema, kheema fry and kheema gotala with incremental prices. Kheema gotala is kheema fried and mashed along with an egg. All three kheema's have their unique taste and I highly recommend the kheema fry. Now being a so-called 'pav wala', I'm inclined to eat kheema with bread but a distinctive accompaniment prepared in-house is the 'parotta'. Normally prepared twice a day, this multi-layered flatbread pairs perfectly with kheema and **I would strongly suggest that you eat the parotta in the restaurant itself while it's hot!**

## Mutton Biryani

The next item I would recommend is the mutton biryani, prepared with spices I won't even begin trying to guess; not too oily and very decently priced, this dish is ample for a single person. Even the chicken biryani is a dish to be relished but I'm more of a red meat person so I'm a bit biased in this.

A quintessential Mughlai dish that Dukes excels at is the buffalo sukha, a spicy semi gravy loaded with chunks of meat that can be eaten with bread or parotta.

## Chinese Food

While Dukes specializes in Mughlai food they have also branched out into Chinese food with a variety of dishes ranging from chicken/veg fried rice and chicken/veg noodles to chicken chilly and chop suey.

To add to this menu, there are many other options which range from soups: sweet corn, manchow, tomato, to name a few; to egg dishes: omelette, bhurji, biryani and half fry(sunny side up).

## Ambience

Although devoid of a washroom, there is a perfectly functional washbasin set up at the far corner and the lack of air conditioning is barely noticed as the large entrance and side window coupled with strategically located fans provides ample cooling even on a humid summer afternoon.

## Delivery

In today's tech-savvy world, Duke's has kept up by taking their business online with the famously popular food delivery apps - Zomato and Swiggy, thus ensuring that they don't stagnate and keep evolving with modern times while still retaining their classic charm. For those who prefer the old fashioned style of calling and placing an order, as long as your delivery is in Bandra west, you can do so by calling on - 02226516315, 02226404137, 7668073403, 7678073417, please note that the last order needs to be placed before 11:30 pm.

This homely restaurant is open 7 days a week beginning the day at 10 in the morning and ending at midnight. These curfew timings I've been assured is only because of the dreaded covid-19 and they will revert to their original timing of opening at 7 in the morning once the pandemic is over. Just a heads up in case you visit this place outside the lunch and dinner hours then you may not get all the dishes.

> To close with I'd like to say that this budget-friendly restaurant is visited by locals and travellers, young and old, not so poor and the not so rich.
