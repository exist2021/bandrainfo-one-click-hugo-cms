<h3>Let’s Chocolati has a strong bond with Bandra…</h3>
<p>Andrea, a born Bandraite, started her chocolate journey, whilst she was very young, baking Christmas cakes, Chocolate cakes and other savories.  Watching her grandparents and parents, the love for dessert-making took its roots.  After she went to live abroad she baked cakes and made chocolates as a hobby which grew into a passion over the years.  Perfecting her techniques and recipes all along the way out of a love forged during childhood, a hobby that grew into a passion gave birth to Let’s Chocolati.  </p>
