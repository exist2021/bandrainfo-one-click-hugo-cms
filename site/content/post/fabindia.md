<p>Fabindia links over 80,000 craft based rural producers to modern urban markets, thereby creating a base for skilled, sustainable rural employment, and preserving India&#8217;s traditional handicrafts in the process.</p>
<p>Fabindia&#8217;s products are natural, craft based, contemporary, and affordable.</p>
<p>Fabindia was founded with the strong belief that there was a need for a vehicle for marketing the vast and diverse craft traditions of India and thereby help fulfill the need to provide and sustain employment. We blend indigenous craft techniques with contemporary designs to bring aesthetic and affordable products to today’s consumers.</p>
<p>Our endeavor is to provide customers with hand crafted products which help support and encourage good craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Our products are sourced from all over India. Fabindia works closely with artisans by providing various inputs including design, quality control, access to raw materials and production coordination. The vision continues to be to maximize the hand made element in our products, whether it is handwoven textiles, hand block printing, hand embroidery or handcrafting home products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fabindia’s endeavour is to bring customers a choice of products – and lifestyle – that offers an alternative to the mass-produced, while creating sustainable livelihoods in the rural sector.</p>
<p>The textile-based product range includes ready-to-wear garments and accessories for men, women, teenagers and children; bed, bath, table and kitchen linen; floor coverings, upholstery fabric and curtains. Cotton, silk, wool, grass, linen and jute are the basic fibres used.</p>
<p>The Home Products range carries furniture, lighting, stationery, tableware, cane baskets and a selection of handcrafted utility items.</p>
<p>Fabindia Organics carries several types of cereals, grains, pulses, spices, sugar, tea, coffee, honey, fruit preserves and herbs across a range of natural and organic certifications.</p>
<p>Fabindia&#8217;s range of authentic Personal care products includes soaps, shampoos, hair oils, pure oils, moisturisers, body scrubs, face packs, hair conditioners &amp; special skin care products.</p>
