<p>A couple of weeks ago, I started reading a lot of articles about this new Japanese restaurant in Bandra and decided I needed to check it out. So when a close friend came visiting from Chennai we went to check it out. It’s a charming compact restaurant (30 seater) from the same folks who run Lemon Grass and Pot Pourri. With Japanese anime art on the wall, origami swans suspended from the ceiling which make for a gorgeous reflection and some Japanese themed collectibles and a fee books its actually an all day hang out. Easy on the wallet and from the menu and what I ate they have taken a fusion or experimentative approach which actually works very well. It was buzzing on a Saturday night.</p>

<p>I ordered the asparagus and blue cheese sushi rolls which were yummy and definitely many repeat visits. They have a lot of variety in the sushi rolls so take your pick. My mains was a Donburi (japanese rice bowl dishes) Shitake, oyster and button mushrooms in chilli sauce served with rice, house vegetables and shredded carrots. That was all right and I think I would try another on my next visit. The drinks are a wide variety of ice teas or mock tails. I tried a Kiwi Iced Sencha (green tea) and that was an interesting flavours but again I would try something else. Well trained waiters, good service though it got busy and I am saying Aoi to Japanese food. I am going back next month for my mum’s Bday and am sure thus can become quite a favourite just like Lemongrass and Pot Pourri have been</p>
