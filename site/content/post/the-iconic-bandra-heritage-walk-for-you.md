<h2 id="9f6ve">What is the typical itinerary and duration of the walk? </h2>
<h3 id="5r66r">The itinerary consists of the following :</h3>
<h2 id="2mhrl">Bandra Fort / Castella De Aguada </h2>
<ul>
<li>Meet at  Land&#x27;s End / Bandra fort and visit its immediate surroundings.  It includes a tourist park with a stunning structure of an adjacent fort and staircases which provide frame- worthy views of the Arabian Sea and the engineering marvel that is &#x27;Bandra Worli Sea Link&#x27; </li>
<li>The fort is believed to be restored by present natives of Bandstand in order to preserve glimpses of the historic structure. Once a halt to quench thirsts of cruising Portugal vessels, today it stands as a watchtower over Mahim Bay, Arabian Sea and Bandra Worli Sea Link with few food stalls round the corner and great selfie points. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="buvjq">Ranwar Village</h2>
<ul>
<li>Move ahead to the iconic  400 year old Ranwar Village, a Christian dominated society, and a complete contrast to the city&#x27;s architecture. Ranwar will remind you of Old Goa houses with people perched comfortably on their balconies along side spiral staircases which you lead you to them. </li>
<li>You may catch the natives holding a pint of beer. Living a carefree life and meeting up in huge groups, a rare occurrence today.  Interestingly none of the windows face each other and open to a bigger view of the street to promote privacy. The street artists have creatively done up the walls which boast of Hindi Cinema&#x27;s iconic artists and talents along with quirky messages. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="9hvta">Mount Mary Church </h2>
<ul>
<li>Next stop is Mount Mary Church, a heritage worship destination visited more often by non-Christians in comparison to Christians.  It is believed to grant all wishes made by the devotees. Interestingly, a provision is made to offer prayers in the true form of the desire, a candle which represents a job, a baby, a new house and so on. </li>
<li>Mother Mary&#x27;s endearing statue is Portuguese in origin. Dating back to 1600s, where she was lovingly positioned by a priest.  Each year in September, post the first Sunday, a fair is hosted to honor and celebrate her birthday. The week long fair attracts a thousand tourists and natives across the city  who indulge in street shopping, food and worship.  There are special play arrangements for kids. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="434cj">Other Churches and Hill Road </h2>
<ul>
<li>The walk may or may not include St. Andrews Church and St. Stephen&#x27;s Church. Spiritual messages are creatively put up on the Church Hoarding and prayers are offered in hope and faith. </li>
<li>The walk ends on Hill Road, one of the main streets of Bandra with leading restaurants, multiplex, shopping malls, hospitals, churches and residential buildings, villages sharing the same stretch for varied purposes. </li>
</ul>
