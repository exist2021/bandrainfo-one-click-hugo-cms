<p class="p1">Bandra is one of the hippest and happening places in the city, filled with lingo that includes “where men”, “what men” and “I’ll break your legs and keep.”</p>
<p class="p1">Confused? Your one stop guide to decoding all the suburb has to offer comes in the form of Clement DeSylva’s book titled Bandra Buggers.</p>
<p class="p1">Clement says, “The book is about stories that have Bandra in the background. It’s about growing up in a middle class household. There are stories that track the changing times from the days when milk came in bottles with aluminium foil caps, to today’s tetra packed which lasts for three months. My grandmother doesn’t believe it can be healthy milk.”</p>
<p class="p1">The response the book has been getting however shows that these stories have an all Mumbai (and even international) appeal. Clement says, “The response has been fabulous. The books have reached Australia and the US already. Everyone identifies with the book at some point.”</p>
<p class="p1">However, the story of the Bandra Buggers doesn’t end here. We will see the blog, which turned into a book, turn into short films. Clement says, “There are just so many stories to tell.”</p>
