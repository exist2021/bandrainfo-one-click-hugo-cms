<p>A new venue catering exclusively to video art and artists opens this Saturday. Having started initially as a residency space and office by What About Art? (WAA), an arts management initiative in Bandra, the yet to-be-launched video projects area opens to public on November 9, with a preview of the newly-launched Translucent Video Art Festival.<br />
Sharing a compound with Bandra Base, the project space will be the first-of-its-kind in the city. According to director Eve Lemesle, WAA hopes a brand-new venue will generate renewed interest in the visual medium in the city. Since video art is simpler to install and display (it usually requires a projector, a screen and a set of speakers), she hopes to bring in works from international artists as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;It opens up possibilities of discovering new artists from across the world working and experimenting with different forms of video.&#8221;</p>
<p>Video art was recognised as a form of artistic expression in the late 1960s, as new technology became accessible outside corporate broadcasting. It is however not to be confused with cinema or television productions, as it works outside most conventional norms of filming.</p>
<p>For example, it may not use actors, might contain no dialogue, or have a discernible narrative or plot. The &#8220;digital video&#8221; revolution of the 1990s also allowed many artists access to employ the use of video as a medium, and continues to be used by many prominent artists, sometimes as part of a larger installation.</p>
<p>The Chameleon Art Projects initiative that will show over 45 films in its larger format in Goa. For the preview, however, curator Kanchi Mehta has chosen works of nine Indian artists whose practice involves the use of video, either as a medium in the work or as means of documentation. The preview will feature works by Ashish Avikunthak, Nikhil Chopra and Munir Kabani, Sahej Rahal, Niyati Upadhyay, Kartik Sood, Jaret Vadehra, Aaditi Joshi, Jehangir Jani and Shambhavi Kaul. &#8220;The selection of films suggests the different themes and areas I will be exploring in the Translucent Video Art Festival,&#8221; says Mehta, who hopes Translucent will become an annual video art festival, and has already put out calls to artists for the next edition.</p>
