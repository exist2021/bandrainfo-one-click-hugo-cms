<p><b>Corporate Training:</b></p>
<p>Are classroom trainings overdone with your employees? Do you find your employees searching for ways to excuse themselves from the trainings?</p>
<p>Extra Mile Café has changed the way employees perceive Training &amp; Development within a Company.</p>
<p>At this Café, Training is based on Kinaesthetic Learning. Through unique training programs, we help employees navigate the hectic highways and byways of the corporate world. Our programs not only drive members away from chalk and talk methods of traditional learning but also encourage lateral thinking.</p>
<p><b>What kind of programs?</b></p>
<p>Every program is considered like a project wherein we allow the participants to plan and execute the task. It makes our programs meaningful (allow participants to actively practice collaboration, communication and decision making), impactful (customized exclusively for the team) and memorable (both fun AND unique). Your trainees are immediately able to see the consequences of wrong actions and the tangible difference that can be made by a change in thinking and behaviour. Our trained facilitators enthusiastically help them to extrapolate the learning from these activities to their workplace.</p>
<p>A few programs to give you a glimpse…</p>
<p>Refine your Leadership skills as Director while making your Film, put on your Creative Hat when publishing your Fashion Magazine, learn the art of Consumer Sensitivity through the platform of Theatre, create a well-rounded Induction video for new joinees or become employee-a-preneurs while building your dream 5* Hotel.</p>
