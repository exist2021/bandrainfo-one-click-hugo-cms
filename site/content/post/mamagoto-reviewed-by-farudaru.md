<p>MAMAGOTO, such a fun name don&#8217;t you think? And the fun &amp; kitsch doesn&#8217;t just end there, the beautiful Japanese style paintings on the walls and a glass full of tigers all over add pizzaz to the place.</p>
<p>The seating is very comfortable and cozy, though the AC could do with a few degrees higher temperature. Their menu is very adorably decorated with cute doodles and is bursting with colour.</p>
<p>This is my new favourite place to slurp up a bowl of noodles and munch on dumplings &#8220;Nom Nom&#8221;. Their service is warm &amp; friendly, but also a little sluggish &amp; inconsistent. And all the delicious aromas wafting around the place make you even more hungry.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of Khowsuey, but the one here is very average. Lemongrass whips up a mean Khowsuey. The Mamagoto Goreng is really good. Flavourful and delicious. Do order.</p>
<p>MUST HAVES:</p>
<p>1) Tom Yum Soup</p>
<p>2) Street Chicken Satay</p>
<p>3) Prawns wrapped in Bacon</p>
<p>4) Teriyaki Meal in a Bowl</p>
<p>5) Mamagoto Goreng</p>
<p>6) Street Vendors Penang Curry Bowl</p>
<p>7) Pad Thai Noodles</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t review the desserts, because I&#8217;ve always been to full to eat any after my meal here. ðŸ˜€</p>
<p>Happy Eating! ðŸ˜€</p>
