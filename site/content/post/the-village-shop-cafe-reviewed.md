<p>It was love at first sight for me with this gorgeous little organic cafe.Â  It&#8217;s quite a refreshing change and just what Bandra needs, in the motley crew of ape-like Chinese,Â Italian &amp; fast food joints.</p>

<p>The fact that most of their ingredients are foraged &amp; locally sourced from ethical and organic sources is like a breath of fresh countryside air. Who&#8217;d ever think that healthy food could also be so mouthwateringly delicious! But The Village Shop is here to prove you wrong! Each dish is stellar &amp; worth eating over &amp; over again.</p>

The decor is invigorating, crisp &amp; unique. White tiles in the outdoor section coupled with all the greenery around you are soothing to the eyes as their food is to the soul.Â A special mention here to the stunning mosaic tile work in the indoor section.</p>
<p>Food: I have to say it, I am yet to find a more delicious VEGGIE LASAGNE than the one I&#8217;ve had here. This is one dish you&#8217;d be stupid not to try.</p>
<p>Meat lovers must try the KHEEMA PAV; it&#8217;s just like your favorite Irani cafe would make it, minus the layer of oil floating on top.</p>
<p>Their MUTTON STEW is one reason I will never ever think of going Vegan! Light &amp; beautifully spiced curry with succulent pieces of mutton, served with brown rice is the stuff of legends.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for something light, yet filling, their Quinoa Salad &amp; Chicken Walnut won&#8217;t disappoint. I personally favor the meat one, though. It&#8217;s the kindÂ food that&#8217;s just perfect for our muggy Bombay weather.</p>
<p>FINAL VERDICT: Please do yourself a favour and visit this stunning little sun-kissed cafe, for some soul food.</p>
<p>MUST HAVES:<br />
1) Veggie Lasagne<br />
2) Chicken Walnut Salad<br />
3) Passion Fruit Juice<br />
4) Lamb Stew<br />
5) Kheema Pav</p>
<p>I am dying to go back for breakfast, so you&#8217;ll hear from me on their breakfast &#8216;Must Haves&#8217; soon!</p>
<p>Happy Eating! ðŸ™‚</p>
