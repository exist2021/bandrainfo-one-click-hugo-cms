It is a tribute to my mother and Aunty Pat, who would make me choose fabrics, advise me on color &amp; cut and help me design it .They would stitch the most wonderfull dresses for me and everytime I wore those dresses I could feel how much they loved me! It made me feel so special; probably that is why I am a designer today. Pinkcow is my effort to make your little one feel like a princess.[/quote]</p>
