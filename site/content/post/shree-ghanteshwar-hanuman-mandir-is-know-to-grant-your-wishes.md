<p>I was cycling around Madhu Park on a Saturday evening, and though it was quite late, there was quite huge Q, I am not a religious person and am averse to the idea of asking a wish from God.</p>
<p>In spite of this I stood in the Q just for the Prasad, the prasad “Sheera + coconut” was delicious. I was reprimanded by an older gentleman (the temple priest probably) for clicking a picture since photography is prohibited. The old man informed me this temple had been there since 1956. There are apparently around 10/15 thousand bells tied inside the temple. The park is attached to Madhu park at Khar.</p>
<blockquote><p>Legend goes that people seek the blessing of Lord Hanuman here.&nbsp; When their wish is fulfilled, they return to the temple and offer Hanuman a bell (thus “Ghanteshwar” which literally means lord of bells).&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, thousands of densely packed brass bells of various sizes hang above and around the temple, which in and of itself is a modest sized place, no more than a large verandah.&nbsp; A few of the bells shine like they have been recently hung, while many more are crusted and darkened with time.<br /><cite> &#8211; via <a href="httpss://yin-yang-india.com/tag/temple-in-khar/">yin-yang-india.com</a></cite></p></blockquote>
