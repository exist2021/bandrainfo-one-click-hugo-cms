Getting ink?</p>
<p>Is it going to be a discreet one or one that covers your whole arm or body?</p>
<p>Is it the stars, flowers, cherubs or other traditionally feminine themes or the gothic, dark, occult or the classic styles?</p>
<p>Is it a choice of Sanskrit or Latin Script?</p>
<p>Enjoy getting them a bit more at Al’s Studio.</p>
