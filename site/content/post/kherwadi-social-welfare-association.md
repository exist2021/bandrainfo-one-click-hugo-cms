<p>Kherwadi Social Welfare Association (KSWA) was founded in 1928 by Late Shri. B.G. Kher, a freedom fighter, statesman and the first Premier of Bombay State. He was moved by the plight and miserable living conditions of the 100 odd tanner families who had settled in the marshes of Bandra (E) called Chamdewalla-ki-Wadi. While he was involved in the freedom struggle, leading two ministries in 1937 and 1946, interspersed with prison terms, his friends and associates continued to work in the area, later known as “Kherwadi”.</p>
<p>The Trust was registered in 1954 and the Trustees and Executive Council have continued to follow the principles of service and commitment to help the poor and underprivileged and adhere to the high principles of simplicity, integrity and commitment set by the founder.</p>
<p>Kherwadi Social Welfare Association started the ‘Yuva Parivartan’ (YP) Movement in 1998 under the leadership of Mr. Kishor Kher and Mrs. Mrinalini Kher to cater to the unmotivated school dropouts and make them economically independent through vocational training. The movement was formally launched in February 2003 by the then President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</p>

An NGO which was cradled in the Kherwadi region of Bandra, is now brimming with endless energy and has spread across the entire nation. In 13 years of its existence, Yuva Parivartan has shown a tremendous growth. The parent centre has now branched out to over 100 centres across 16 states of India, which includes 44 Livelihood Development Centres, more than 100 Partnership Centres and 5 jail Centres. As one of the largest NGOs of India that works for the school drop-out youth, we strongly believe that the nation’s strength and future lies in the hands of its youth. Unlike the developed countries where 90% youth opts for some or the other sort of vocational training, less than 5% get into vocational training in our country despite the fact that India is a country with the largest youth population.</p>
<p>From 100 students to 4,00,000 students, from 1 centre to more than 100 centres, from the tribal areas of Maharashtra to the snow-clad Kashmir, Yuva Parivartan has expanded its horizons to become a national movement.</p>
<p>At Yuva Parivartan, we provide:</p>
<p>Vocational training (70% practicals &amp; 30% theory)</p>
<p>Life skills such as Decision making, Time Management, Money Management, Values &amp; Perception, health &amp; hygiene etc.</p>
<p>Enable English speaking and computer training courses</p>
<p>Work readiness</p>
<p>Counselling</p>
<p>Job placements and assistance in getting self-employed.</p>
<p>Annually, we empower 10,000 school dropouts out of which 60% are employed and a few of them take a bigger leap of becoming an entrepreneur. We adopt a holistic approach of enhancing the less fortunate youth with vocational skills, guidance, counselling and financial assistance.</p>
<p>Yuva Parivartan’s flexible and innovative model has been appreciated by the Planning Commission and has proved effective in the urban, rural and tribal belts. Our model ensures that the local community needs are met and thus benefiting the youth as well as the entire community or village.</p>
<p>Thus, Yuva Parivartan is an inspired movement with a desire to bring about a change for the betterment of the society and the nation.</p>
