<blockquote><p>Timeless is a short documentary that weaves together inspiring and heart tugging stories of people who reside in an elderly home in Mumbai. The film follows a group of young people from Bollywood as they curiously delve into the everyday lives of the people at Azad&#8217;s, and how they infuse happiness in their lives by giving them something which is of utmost importance, their time. </p>
