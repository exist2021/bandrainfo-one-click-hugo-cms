<p><b>What is Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)?</b></p>
<p>Mixed Martial Arts or MMA is also known as no holds barred or cage fighting. In modern times, no holds barred events have attracted various fighting styles, to include: The Fight Federation Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, Greco-Roman wrestling, boxing, traditional martial arts forms, and street fighting techniques. Events like the Ultimate Fighting Championships have spawned a growing fan base and attracted talented competitors.</p>
<p>Historically, the Greeks promoted a sport called pankration, which was introduced into the Olympic games more than 2,500 years ago and demonstrated many of the modern day fighting techniques found in Mixed Martial Arts. With the resurgence of the sport, the Olympic Games Committee considered adding pankration into the 2004 Summer Olympics.</p>
