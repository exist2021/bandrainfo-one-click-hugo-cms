<p>Customers are encouraged to be active citizens who spread an environmental and social message through their consumer choices. We aim to make people think about the issue of waste disposal and hope to change attitudes. A portion of GtG profits is used to further develop Swechha’s active citizenship programmes.</p>
<p>Green the Gap was set up by the NGO Swechha in Delhi as a way of raising awareness on environmental issues and providing secure employment with reasonable wages for disadvantaged people. By reusing waste in innovative ways to create high quality, useful products, Green the Gap empowers consumers to make choices about their shopping habits.</p>
<p>MATERIAL :</p>
<p>India’s recyclers have set up impromptu markets throughout cities where different waste materials are resold. Green the Gap uses juice cartons, rubber vehicle tires, and waste fabrics sourced locally in Delhi. New, high quality products are made with items that have been thrown away, giving them a second life. Nothing is wasted.</p>
<p>PRODUCTION:</p>
<p>The Green the Gap workshop is in Malviya Nagar, South Delhi &#8211; right next to the Swechha office. We employ tailors from disadvantaged backgrounds who were looking for better working conditions compared to their previous posts in larger factories in Delhi (where working hours are long, pay is low, and strict production targets must be met). We offer them fair remuneration and decent working conditions, as part of a friendly and small team</p>
