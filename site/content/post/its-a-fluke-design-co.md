<p>“Fluke” is the destination for the modern design connoisseur, the place where Art, innovation and product design come together as one to serve unique needs of eclectic luxury in lifestyle and fashion. We strongly believe in mixing moderns with classics, colors with texture, simple lines with sexy curves and glamour with practicality. The limited edition products created by us are both visually and sensually delightful. Each product in our catalogue is crafted and painted by hand, following which all the products (paint &amp; surface) are tested for its durability.</p>
<p>Fluke Design Company is the brainchild of RASHMI DOGRA who is an artist, product designer and a serious fashionista.&nbsp; She is always compelled to create, no matter what medium she uses, her goals as an artist and product designer remain the same. Inspiration to her comes from everyday life, different cultures, and personalities.</p>
<p>“I like to share my art with the world but it does come with a unique perspective I have on life. Whether intended or not, my work builds a cumulative aura, a signature of my style. As an artist I always keep in mind not to avoid the details.” says Rashmi Dogra.</p>
<p>Fluke gives you flavor of cultural uniqueness as you browse through its spectacular displays.</p>
