If you are a regular at NCPA, then you will recognise Manju Sampat as one of the regulars. I often bump into Manju and her affable husband Sunil Sampat (who organises Jazz Events) at NCPA and other good events in Bandra too.

Manju Sampat regularly reviews plays for us and her reviews keep Bandraites informed on the theatre scene in Mumbai.

> It was about time, I thought we should know about her work and life. Also, she has lived in Bandra since 1973, isn't that amazing??

## Can you introduce yourself in your own words to our readers?

My name is Manju Sampat, and currently, I write theatre reviews and occasionally conduct Public Speaking classes on a one to one basis. Till very recently I was organising a Verbal Communication Course called The Art of Speaking for my organisation The Learning Curve. These classes were held at St. Andrews College in Bandra, and our faculty comprised of eminent speakers like Tom Alter, Jerry Pinto, Asif Ali Beg and a host of others. Modules are now taught as per request, but Learning Curve still functions.

In the past, I was into academics, as I was working towards getting a PhD in Literature from Bombay University and I got this in 1999.

Before that, I was in the airline industry and this enabled my husband Sunil and myself to travel the world with our two daughters Puja and Payal. At present they both live in California with their children. We have four grandchildren.

## How long you have been living in Bandra, and why did you (your family) choose Bandra?

After I got married Sunil and I lived in Montreal for seven years and returned to Bombay in 1972. The very next year we moved to Bandra from south Bombay and have been living here ever since. Both our girls studied at Petit School in Bandra, and then graduated from St. Xavier’s College before going to the U.S for their Master’s. Bandra is a comfortable and green suburb to live in and we love living here and would not change our home for anything in the world!

## As you are a theatre critic. How would you describe the theatre and art scene in Bandra compared to South Mumbai?

Compared to south Bombay, Bandra has fewer theatre venues but new and interesting ones keep opening up. **I am especially fond of the Jeff Goldberg Studio and The Cuckoo Club. Both are delightful intimate spaces. There is, of course, the wonderful St. Andrews auditorium and a few years ago the elegant Rang Mandir theatre on Linking Road opened as well**. Theatre is very much alive and kicking in Bandra, and theatre groups like Akavarious, Thesbo, and new ones like Jeff Goldberg’s and Making Noise and others from South Bombay like Rage, Ace Productions and also groups that normally perform at Prithvi Theatre, ensure that the appreciative Bandra audiences get their fill of theatre.

## Which are your favourite places in Bandra to dine, shop and watch plays?

My favourite dining places in Bandra are Out of the Blue, Salt Water Grill and Izumi, for good food. For Chinese food, we love China Gate and House of Mandarin. BlueBop Cafe on Linking Road has great jazz and good comfort food. Soul Fry in Pali Market is another favourite for its friendly atmosphere. Nothing beats Punjab Samosas, and also some of the wonderful bakeries that we have in abundance, like Candies or American Express.

I am not a great shopper but enjoy looking around the shoe shops on Linking Road and browsing around Hill Road. Fab India is my go-to destination if I am looking for a gift.

**I love going to see plays at Rang Mandir and The Jeff Goldberg Studio. Prithvi is an old favourite even though it is not in Bandra.**

## How has Bandra changed over the years?

Of course, it has. When we first came here in 1973, there was a lot less congestion and traffic. There were fewer buildings and therefore a smaller population. Unfortunately, our narrow roads have made the situation even worse. Some things are better though, Carter road’s promenade for one. It is a boon for those who enjoy walking as is our beautiful Jogger’s Park. However, the wonderful Bandra folks are its greatest asset, friendly and always helpful.
