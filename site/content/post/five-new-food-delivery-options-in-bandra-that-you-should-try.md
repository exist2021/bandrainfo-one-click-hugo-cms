<p dir="auto">Has Netflix ruined your social life and all you want to do is lounge around in your PJs, chilling? Does the rain (or the sun) make it extremely difficult for you to step out and grab a bite? Do you conveniently forget your <em>dabba</em> at home so that you can order in at work? If just like me you belong to all three categories, or even one, read on! Here is a round up of a few delivery options that I&#8217;ve tried (and loved) in the past few weeks. There&#8217;s something for everyone! </p>
<p dir="ltr">1. <strong><u>If you&#8217;re craving some Punjabi Khana Shaana &#8211;</u></strong><br />If you&#8217;re cheating in your diet, cheat with something unapologetically sinful like the food from <strong>Oye Panjabi</strong> kitchen. It is also the sort of food you crave after you&#8217;re three patiala pegs down, looking for some serious grease to wash it all away. Oye Panjabi takes a detour from their spot on the Nashik highway and delivers out fare from their Khar kitchen. The menu covers all your Punjabi food staples &#8211; kebabs, kulchas, cream laden curries, and more. Major plus points to the packaging (not a drop of oil leaked), and the ginormous portion sizes.<br />The food here is exactly what you&#8217;d expect from a Punjabi delivery joint &#8211; smokey tikkas, gravies laden with cream, naans and parathas with a dollop of ghee on top. Though Oye Panjabi is a tad bit more expensive than the Punjabi food places we&#8217;ve grown up ordering from in Bandra, they make up for in their generosity.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><u>Must Try:</u></em> Their Kaali Daal &#8211; exactly like how they make it in the <em>dhabhas</em>, Sarson Da Saag with Makkai Roti &#8211; all year around, and their famous Chicken &#8216;Peprika&#8217; (sic) Kebabs.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><u>Contact:</u> Call 70454 57071/72 for delivery between Bandra and Santacruz.<br />Available for online delivery on Zomato and Scootsy.</p>

<p dir="ltr">2. <strong><u>If you want the meat sweats &#8211; </u></strong><br />Put on Joey&#8217;s Thanksgiving pants after you order in from <strong>Death By BBQ</strong>, because you&#8217;ll need them. This Bandra based, delivery only joint serves up barbecued pork ribs, pulled pork, grilled chicken, and short ribs in addition to sandwiches and sides. The menu may be limited, but what they lack in variety they make up for in flavour.<br />All their dishes are characterized by three qualities that are inherent to a good BBQ &#8211; tender meat, delicious seasoning and flavour, and that smokiness that can only come by slow cooking the meat for hours. Death By BBQ may be pricier than your regular delivery joint, but is absolutely worth every penny considering the quality of the meat and the how perfectly right they treat it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><u>Must Try:</u></em> Kansas Style City Ribs &#8211; finger lickingly good and the Memphis style Pulled Pork &#8211; meat that does not require any mastication.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><u>Contact:</u></em> Death By BBQ, Call 8291381008 / 8291381009 </p>
<p dir="ltr">Available online for delivery through Scootsy, Zomato and Swiggy. <br />Delivery free between Bandra and Juhu. For other areas a minimum order of Rs 1000 is required.</p>

<p dir="ltr">3. <strong><u>If you&#8217;re missing your Sindhi friend&#8217;s <em>dabba</em> (I know I am) &#8211;</u></strong><br />You don&#8217;t have to stand in serpentine queues at Tharu&#8217;s in Khar every Sunday for your share of Dal Pakwaan and Sindhi Kadhi. <strong>Sindhful</strong> is the best thing to have happened to Sindhi food aficionados like me. Skip the regular kebabs and curries on their menu, and move straight onto their Sindhi fare. Here you&#8217;ll find your staples like Sindhi Kadhi Chawal, Aloo Tuk, Dal Pakwaan, Sai Bhaji and a couple of never tried before non-vegetarian options.<br />I can vouch for the authenticity of their food, having had a fair share of Sindhi home cooked meals in my days. Sindhful is easy on the pocket, with justifiable portion sizes. I&#8217;d like to raise my Aloo Tuk to more regional, home-style dining options in the city.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><u>Must Try:</u> The Dal Pakwaan and the Sindhi Kadhi for comfort food at it&#8217;s best. Also the Sindhi style Kheema Pav &#8211; a twist on the Irani classic!</p>
<p><em><u>Contact:</u></em> Sindhful, Call 022 33715923 for delivery between Khar and Santacruz.<br />Available online for delivery on Zomato, Scootsy and Swiggy for a wider delivery radius.</p>

<p dir="ltr">4. <strong><u>If you&#8217;re attempting to eat clean &#8211;</u></strong><br /><strong>Fellas Cafe</strong> was one of the first to introduce healthy eating as a dine out option roughly a decade ago, before Bandra became the hipster health food capital it now is. They recently re-located to a newer smaller location in Khar, with an added emphasis on healthy food delivery. The menu is an interesting mix of salads (duh!), juices, smoothies, and mains. The pizzas are made of an interesting, multigrain, super-thin base making it a healthier alternative to your regular pizza, but definitely not something you should be eating on a diet because of the oodles of cheese on top! <br />What I personally like about the food at Fellas is that each dish has a calorie count stated on the side, so that you can make an informed decision when you order. The food is comforting, wholesome, and definitely not pocket pinching unlike some newer healthy food places that have opened up in the suburbs. Major props for being pet friendly!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><u>Must Try:</u> Their interesting multigrain pizzas, their Happy Vegan Salad for a fullfilling meal at 169 calories, and their assortment of Grilled Chicken dishes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><u>Contact:</u> +91 9769879115 for delivery in the Bandra-Santacruz radius.<br />Available online for delivery on Zomato and Scootsy.</p>

<p dir="ltr">5. <u><strong>If you&#8217;re looking for yet another biryani delivery joint &#8211;</strong></u> <br />2015 was the year biryani became cool again. It came packaged to us in funky boxes, in variants we&#8217;d never heard of before, with individual biryani delivery apps that helped us attain that dream of having biryani for office lunch. Joining the bandwagon, albeit a bit late in Mumbai, is <strong>Behrouz Biryani</strong>. Their USP is supposed to be their Persian inspired recipe. <br />What I particularly liked about the biryani that I ordered home was the liberal use of almond slivers, raisins, and saffron that makes the dish flavorful and aromatic. Also the biryani rates low on the oil and spice factor, so no acid reflux the next day as well! Though the raita was watered down and insipid, the salan was deliciously thick and spicy. Though marginally pricier than your other online biryani delivery options, a single portion size can easily serve two.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><u>Contact:</u> Order online on <a href="https://www.behrouzbiryani.com/">www.behrouzbiryani.com</a> or via Zomato, Swiggy, Scootsy.</p>
