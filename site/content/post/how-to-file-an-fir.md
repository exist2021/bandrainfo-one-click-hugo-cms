<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-5988 alignright" alt="KYR" src="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/KYR.png?resize=170%2C125&#038;ssl=1" width="170" height="125" data-recalc-dims="1" />Technically an FIR refers to the information on the commission of an offence given to a police officer by the first informant. In other words, it is basically a complaint document that sets the provisions of the criminal law in motion.</p>
<p>To begin with, it is important to primarily understand the difference between Cognizable and Non-Cognizable offences. And FIR is filed for cognizable offences.<br />
Under the Criminal Procedure Code, commonly known as CrPC, a cognizable offence allows the police to directly register an FIR and immediately begin investigation. The accused can also be arrested without a Warrant. Rape, murder, kidnapping and theft are examples of offences that fall into this category.<br />
In a Non-Cognizable Offence, the police will require the permission of the court to register a case or investigate. The accused cannot be arrested without a Warrant and the offence is bailable. Examples of non-cognizable offences include criminal intimidation, trespassing, making a public nuisance of oneself, misappropriation of property, physical assault, forgery, causing simple hurt, and simple cheating.</p>
