<p>Fresh grilled chicken patty, beans, onion, lettuce, cheddar cheese, crisp fried bacon and fried egg when you happily browse through a copy of Archies comics.</p>
<p>Rejoice. You are having breakfast at Between Breads.</p>

<p>Nestled in a busy street, you will love the small and snug &#8211; look and feel of the place.</p>
<p>The food is a curious mix complete in itself with hot dogs, sandwiches, burgers, milkshakes, dips and salads making it one of the best places to spend quality time with friends and family. The Morning After Toasted Baguette or the philly cheese sandwiches are a drawing factor among patrons.</p>

<p>More than pacifying taste buds, you just can’t have enough.</p>
<p>There’s no dearth of eateries and cafes in Bandra, but Between Breads makes it worth more than one visit.</p>
<p>Bon appétit.</p>
