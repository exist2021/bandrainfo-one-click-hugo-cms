<p>The Walk of the Stars was a section of the Bandstand Promenade in Bandra, Mumbai honouring Bollywood film stars. The path featured about six statues of famous Bollywood actors as well as about 100 brass plates embossed with the handprints and signatures of other stars. The walk was inspired by the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was funded and privately managed by UTV and promoted through their UTV Stars television channel.The walk is 2 km long. It was inaugurated by actress Kareena Kapoor on 28 March 2012, with actor Randhir Kapoor and filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar also present.</p>

<p>Well it seems like UTV got bought over by Disney, which probably thought, Bollywood stars don&#8217;t deserve such pampering and decided to axe it. My google search hasn&#8217;t revealed any news as to the precise reason for the UTV walk of stars to get the axe, so my presumption maybe right.</p>
<p>Not really sure, how these expensive bronze statues of these stars would inspire a resident except a starstruck person to take a selfie. I am certainly not missing it, but what about you?</p>
