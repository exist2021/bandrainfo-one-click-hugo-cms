It has since then been administered by a Board of Trustees. In 1963 the Board decided to accept day scholars from all communities. The school has gradually developed over the years until it has evolved into a full fledged Secondary School. The school is a recognized private unaided minority institution.</p>
<p>The school is affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination, which has its office in New Delhi. It prepares students for the ICSE (Class X) examinations. The first batch of Class X had appeared for the ICSE examination in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>School Structure</strong></p>
