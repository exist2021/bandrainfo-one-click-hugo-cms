<p>I have been following Trivan on twitter and was impressed by this young guy who is an amazingly vigilant citizen. He interacts on various citizen journalist platforms and actively follows up on social causes. Here is short interview with Trivan who generally prefers his work to do the talking , but has obliged me with a request for an interview. Do get in touch with him for voters card he is on&nbsp;Twitter- @trivan205.</p>
<p><b><img loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-4184" alt="image" src="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/image1-e1380006029159.jpeg?resize=288%2C384&#038;ssl=1" width="288" height="384" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/image1-e1380006029159.jpeg?w=480&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/image1-e1380006029159.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" data-recalc-dims="1" />1. How long have you been living in Bandra/khar? And why did you decide to make Bandra as your home?</b></p>
<p>I have been staying here since birth. From kindergarden to post graduation, this place has been close to my heart.</p>
<p><b>2. Can you share some of your experiences of living in Bandra/khar right from the day you selected the property, till today? How has Bandra/khar changed in your opinion?</b></p>
<p>Bandra is full of life &amp; glamour, but has lost it&#8217;s charm. In the past 10years we have seen tremendous change. The population in Bandra itself has become very dense &amp; we have increasing immigrants settling here. This is one of the reasons for the increasing crime rate in the area.</p>
<p><b>3. What kind of extra amenities would you like, which are at present lacking in Bandra/khar?</b></p>
<p>Well, Since mumbaikar&#8217;s are one of the highest taxpayers which includes Bandra residents &amp; the least I expect is good quality roads without potholes, decent usable public toilets &amp; more dustbins on streets.</p>
<p>Also I wish that &#8220;illegal hawkers&#8221; are removed &amp; criminal action is initiated against them. They are causing inconvenience to a lot of Bandra residents.</p>
<p><b>4) What do you think is the biggest advantage of living in Bandra ? And what to do you think is the single most disadvantage of living here in Bandra/khar?</b></p>
<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t find a specific advantage of living in Bandra, other than my propriety value sky rocketing. I personally feel with the increasing density of people, Bandra has lost it&#8217;s charm.</p>
<p><b>5.) Can you tell us something about professional life?&nbsp;6. What kind of hobbies do you have? What are your passions in life?</b></p>
<p>I am a mass media graduate &amp; currently studying LLB (law) in my second year. I was interning with Bandra Court&#8217;s senior most lawyer Adv. Zameer Khan, so yes it was a great experience working under him. I got to learn a lot.</p>
<p>My hobby is social work. I am also a &#8216;News&#8217; junkie. During my free time I am busy spreading social awareness, facts &amp; spreading legal knowledge on social media. Apart from that I also help unprivileged people with govt. or local municipal issues on ground level. Moreover, I have gained over 5,000 followers on twitter by spreading facts, awareness, standing up &amp; fearlessly condemning against unlawful acts &amp; giving my opinions on various social issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#8217;m passionate about what I do &amp; what I propagate. I am a vigilant citizen who passionately works for change &amp; pressurize for good governance.&nbsp;I know the Laws of the land &amp; i don&#8217;t fear anybody.&nbsp;Lastly, I will continue fighting today for a better tomorrow.</p>
