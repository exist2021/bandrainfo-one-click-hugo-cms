<h3>What pushed Brenda to write this book.</h3>



<p>She has written a book called &#8220;My journey through wonderland&#8221;.</p>



<p>Fredrick Narohna (from Goa) has been Pushing Brenda to write this book. She stared in 1992. She never thought it would see the light of the day. There a lot of big names involved so she was hesitating to publish.</p>



<p>The publisher encouraged to put in real names. Brenda says it was massive work as all papers were to be organised as proof to prevent any litigations.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Note &#8211; some names had to changed like the main antagonist. </p></blockquote>
