<p>A 60’s European style restaurant with two levels, each split into an al fresco and air-conditioned areas, it’s more than welcoming with its dimly light ambience, rusted iron and exposed walls, heritage tiled-floors and lush green plants.</p>
<p>Pali Village Café has set a name for itself and is one of the finest eateries in Bandra.</p>
<p>If fine dining is on your mind, this is where you should come. Exquisite wines, delectable appetizers, a soothing ambience, guitar instrumentals and conversations around the candle light will add to your mesmerizing experience.</p>
