Ogaan means “wave” in Sanskrit and the boutiques are pared down architectural experiences, with a carefully chosen mix of Indian and fusion clothing, accessories and jewelry. Displays and styling are reminiscent of galleries or installations, making Ogaan a design experience, a canvas for Indian fashion, as much as a store. Ogaan first opened in Hauz Khas Village in New Delhi in 1989, with the vision of giving a platform to Indian design, textiles, and craft skills. It was the first store of its kind in the city. The biggest names in Indian fashion have shown their first collections here. The store continues to showcase the best new talent and explore new aesthetics, mixing the traditional and the contemporary with its signature style and elegance. Ogaan has six boutiques in Delhi and Mumbai. The flagship is at Hauz Khas Village, spread over 6,000 Sq. Ft. In New Delhi, other boutiques are in Santushti, Khan Market and Emporio Mall. In Mumbai, Ogaan is in Colaba and Khar. <b>About Kavita Bhartia                                                      </b> Kavita Bhartia started Ogaan in 1989. Much before Indian fashion found its place on a global stage, she saw the potential for Indian design. She put together Ogaan as an exhibition space, a design showcase, as well as a unique retail experience. Her forte lies in visual display, and in the curation and interpretation of new trends. Through her, Ogaan is as much a gallery for Indian clothing trends as it is a store – a space where disparate threads in Indian fashion (handwork, drapes, textile, and stripped down modernism) combine effortlessly. Kavita Bhartia started her own line of clothing in 2000. The Kavita Bhartia line retails at all Ogaan stores.
