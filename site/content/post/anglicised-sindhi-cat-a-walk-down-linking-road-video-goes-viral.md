<p>I have always wanted to take a video of linking road, but many times the street hawkers have warned me not to click pictures of them, as they peddle spurious stuff. Also the fact that my video editing skills are pathetic, but this anglicised sindhi cat has done one great job of the the video, i guess the accent helps and he is free to record. Watch this amazing short video of linking road, bandra, it doesn&#8217;t get crazier than this place.</p>
