<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/nm-logo.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4980 alignright" alt="nm logo" src="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/nm-logo.jpg?resize=220%2C178&#038;ssl=1" width="220" height="178" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>NM Medical is the pioneer of radiology, cardiology, pathology, and preventive health checkups in a diagnostic centre setting in India.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, NM Medical was the first to introduce Ultrasound into the private practice domain.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, NM Medical introduced preventive cardiology and pathology into the diagnostic centre model as also CT Scan and MRI for the first time outside a hospital setup.</p>
<p>In the 2000s NM Medical introduced the concept of corporate health checkups, which was then replicated by many other institutes but never with comparable success to as no other centre possesses the complete set of facilities that NM Medical offers under one roof with the requisite level of service expertise.</p>
<p>NM Medical is designed to de-stress and perhaps add a bit of fun to the realm of preventive healthcare. It creates a refreshingly different healthcare experience as it is free from the stressful smells, exposure to sick patients and shuffling across various departments on different floors, commonly associated with health check-up at hospitals. The waiting lounge at NM Medical is inspired by the insides of a luxury jetliner with a happening business cum entertainment centre, staffed with guest relation executives to complete the picture.</p>
<p>Since 2010 NM Medical has been accredited by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) as per ISO 15189:2007 standards. Less than 0.2% of medical laboratories in India are accredited by NABL.</p>
<p>As per the annual report on hospitals and diagnostic centres nationwide published by Newsweek in 2010, NM Medical is ranked among the top 3 diagnostic facilities in Mumbai. Among these 3 facilities, NM Medical is the only one offering the unique combination of pathology and radiology under one roof and that too in a private centre setting with multiple locations.</p>
