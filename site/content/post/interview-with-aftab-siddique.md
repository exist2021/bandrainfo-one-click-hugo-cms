Last month we had signature campaign on this too. Almost more than 500 students from vicinity colleges and residents have signed.</p>
<p>r). Answered in question 3 below.</p>
<p>Presently, BMC has no plans on illegal hawkers and compound encroachments in 7 malls in 33rd road.</p>

<p><strong>3. What do you think about the current project of underground shopping mall at Patwardhan Park and what would be the eventual fall out of the hawkers?</strong></p>
<p>From Dec 2015, Residents in support of licence stalls are having a strong fight with BMC opposing the mindless beautification proposal of linking road Khar opposite National College .The proposal is 100 crores and not approved by any authority but BMC wants to shift 167 licence stalls on road . Underground shopping mall is out of question as it&#8217;s unsafe not only for stalls but also shoppers as Mumbai City is in red alert most of the time. It will be a very costly affair for stall owners . Cost if A/C etc. Health hazard too. Concept of basement pedestrian walk of shopping plaza is a failure in Mumbai City.</p>

Could you tell us, about your life in Bandra and what do you particularly think about bandra and some of your favourite places in Bandra?</strong></p>
<p>My favourite place in H-W where I love to relax or just sit with my friends chatting or eating is at Carter Road. I&#8217;m a non vegetarian and relish food from quite a few restaurants. Fortunately H-W ward is blessed with many restaurants .</p>
<p>I am a foodie but not a party animal. I&#8217;m an introvert. I love to spend time with my family, friends and close associates which I hardly get time.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>5. What are some of the changes you would like to see in Bandra which doesn’t conflict with the current governments vision of development?</strong></p>
<p>The changes that I would like to see in Bandra, Khar, Santacruz is :-<br />
I had carried a lot of Silent Protest agitation against BMC and Police high handedness demanding quality and timely services.</p>
<p>1.) Politicians should stop interfering with every government work and accept citizens perspective positively. Politicians seek help from alms and associations but both bureaucrats and politicians don&#8217;t like them and are always opposing in alm meetings.</p>
<p>2.) Curb encouraging illegal work.</p>
<p>3.) Greenery seems to be disappearing from HW ward. Our important main roads have started to look concrete.</p>
<p>4.) Organise Sporting Events in Public Spaces (RG and PG) for all age groups.</p>
<p>5.) Remove that major Bandra skywalk obstructing traffic.</p>
<p>6.) Presently all redevelopment projects in Bandra specially Khar and Santacruz ( W) are getting open space condition. In near future, how will roads be widened.</p>
<p>7.) There has to be a soft approach of BMC and specially Police officers. The West Region Police seems accountable to no one and is turning to be a shelter home for anti-socials. People are being assaulted , proper cases are not being registered. Every issues Police has started to ask people for sections and IPC or directing people to move to court.</p>
<p>8.) Install CCTV in sensitive and crime areas such as Linking Road KFC Jn , SV road at Khar Traffic junction, Lucky junction.Cameras installed by cops are not accurately focused.Seems deliberate. No proper PWD to maintain.</p>
<p>Police has a huge back log of inquiries. In hurry they end up diluting issues.</p>
<p>9.) Too many VIP bandobast in Bandra &amp; Khar has to be stopped. Why so may Police staff is in Special duty of politicians. eg Narayan Rane , Sushil Kumar Shinde etc. When is Police going to serve a common man.</p>
<p>10.)I want youth to not only participate in organising programmes but also be a part of the system. Help being eyes and ears for good governance.</p>
<p>11.) I want the Gazdhar Bandh area, Daulat Nagar area and Road attached to Bandra Rly stn to look better. One can&#8217;t believe that in heart of city such areas and antisocial joints exist.</p>
<p>12.) Improve or Redevelop the Railway quarters on SV road , Police quarters at Carter Road. The conference room of Adtnl CP on ground floor.</p>
<p>13.) Improve all Municipal Markets.Implement Vendor Policy pending from 2014 so that people do not suffer and are not deprived of livelihood. This will make Roads free from illegal vending. (Loacl Police is responsible to put illegal vendors).</p>
<p>14.) Make parking slots or space for all heavy vehicles defacing SV road.</p>
<p>15.) Uplift Municipal schools infrastructure and standards. We have 7-8 major slums in HW ward and around 7 big Municipal schools.</p>
