<p><strong>Sussanne Roshan, Seema Khan and Maheep Kapoor give Bandra its first luxury concept boutique: BANDRA 190.</strong></p>
<p>Three fashion and style divas are working round the clock to give Bandra its first luxury retail boutique called Bandra 190. Founder members Sussanne Roshan, Seema Khan and Maheep Kapoor have put together their artistic minds to create a plush shopping experience for the new-age buyer. Bandra 190, located at the tony Turner Road, is a conceptual retail store that will stand apart from the rest by virtue of its eclectic and edgy experience.</p>
<p>Styled to feel like New York City’s SoHo district, famous for its trendy boutiques and art galleries, Bandra 190 too will have its very own distinct character that will leave a mark in the minds and hearts of all who visit. Scheduled to launch in the first week of December, with interiors designed by Sussanne Roshan, the six-storey luxury boutique that spreads over 6000 sq ft will house some of the biggest brands in the Indian and international fashion and design industry.</p>
<p>In Sussanne Roshan’s words, “Bandra 190 is a one-stop shop where a great variety will be found and one will experience a certain novelty that one sees in new-age buying. It’s reflective of the new shabby chic that one sees in today’s lifestyles. The experience will be one of a jewel box, which you will enter, and then decide where you want to go.”Sussanne’s design for the store incorporates both masculine and feminine elements, keeping in mind the fact that both men and women will equally frequent the store.</p>
<p>In this venture, supported by Shravan Satyani of Satyani Fine Jewels, the three talented women &#8211; Seema Khan, Sussanne Roshan and Maheep Kapoor &#8211; have beautifully complemented each others’ aesthetic sensibilities and astute business acumen. With each having several years of experience and with their pulse firmly on the luxury and design space, these creative minds promise to create a paradigm shift in the luxury retail space, giving the consumer a special experience of buying luxury brands. From clothes to shoes to jewellery and home products, Bandra 190 will have everything the new-age buyer looks for, and all under one roof!</p>
<p>The ground floor will have classic jewellery pieces by Maheep Kapoor for Satyani Fine Jewels, the first and second floor will house The Charcoal Project by Sussanne Roshan with fine gifting items and home interior pieces, the third floor will be stocked with blingy elegant Indian and western clothes by Seema Khan, while the fourth will have the famous red stiletto shoes by French brand Christian Louboutin and the fifth and sixth will display several fashion brands for men and women like Alexander McQueen, Alice + Olivia, Chloe, DVF, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Herve Leger, Victoria Beckham and Stella McCartney brought in by Charu and Priya Sachdev under the brand name Kitsch.</p>
