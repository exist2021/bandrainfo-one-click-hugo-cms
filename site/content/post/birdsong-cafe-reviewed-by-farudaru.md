The ceiling to floor French windows are a delight. They let in loads of natural light and they&#8217;re perfect to just sit by them over a cup of coffee &amp; vegan carrot cake and just watch the world go by.</p>
<p>The Birdsong is a super pretty all organic Cafe, with tasty, wholesome, fresh &amp; natural food. The cafe is dotted with wooden tables &amp; chairs with pretty upholstery. Seating is also quite comfortable. The have a lovely hand painted wall with cute quotes and doodles, a huge black board with their hand-written menu, lovely light bulbs hanging from the high ceiling, which give the cafe a unique character.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been here quite a few times and i have to say, i&#8217;m quite impressed with the changes and progress they&#8217;ve made regarding their glitchy service and food, Meat eaters rejoice, because they now also serve organic chicken. Their service used to be really bad, but recently that too has improved.</p>
<p>The food so really good and you can actually taste the natural goodness of the ingredients. Jennifer&#8217;s famous organic cakes, are to die for especially the Carrot Cake &amp; coconut banana cake, Now, i can&#8217;t choose one favourite dish here, because there are just too many that i like.</p>
