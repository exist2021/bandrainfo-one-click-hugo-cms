<p>I was curious to see what the futuristic garden looks like, so I headed to the recently opened reliance Jio garden at BKC.</p>
<p>Once you buy a 10 Rs ticket for 3 hours, you scan your ticket into one of those entry pods, which logs in your in time. As I had entered the garden (calling it a garden is misnomer) because i could hardly see any trees, but then I realised the trees are lined on the sides and are now babies and will take more than couple of years to grow to their adult size.</p>
<p>The garden seems more of a venue for concerts with a 1000 (which will scale to 2000 cars) cars which can be parked below it. The grass is synthetic made from polymer which is another reason this place should be called a garden. The fountains were not yet working as it&#8217;s still doesn&#8217;t have enough footfalls.</p>
<p>If this mass manufacturing of gardens in a assembly line, Reliance Jio which plans to set up many more of such gardens has got it quite on the sweet spot. I plan never to visit this garden again unless it&#8217;s a music concert. (<a href="https://www.meraevents.com/vh1supersonicskrillexindiatour/">skillrex scheduled</a> to play on 10th OCT).Â To sum it up this was the most boring garden I have been to yet, but it could be a great concert venue.</p>
