<p>Sanjeev Chadha’s passion for fitness and bodybuilding has been on simmer for a long time but in recent years it has ignited and subsumed him. The accolades have been varied and many: Mr. India, in the Master’s category for three years in a row from 2009 to 2011.4th at the Asian Championships held in Bahrain, 12th in the World Championships in Poland and a lot more. Enough for the average Joe to hang up his boots. But instead, Sanjeev decided to set up a game-changer gym.</p>

<p><strong>Why “the red gym”?</strong></p>
<p>“Passion and perfection are too precious to be managed by others. I was terribly disappointed that all the much-touted gyms would not permit me to train with my personal instructor: the only person who knew my body,mind and motivations as well I did or perhaps better. Why would I entrust my passion to a stranger, especially someone whose interests were mostly about many and money than me”.</p>
<p>“So I decided on the “<strong>Twogether</strong>” concept gym. You just can’t join ‘the red gym’ without a personal trainer. If you are new to fitness training and bodybuilding, we will source a trainer best suited to your needs.And if you have been training earlier ensure your collaborator always accompanies you. Simple but satisfying and very efficient for the client.”</p>
