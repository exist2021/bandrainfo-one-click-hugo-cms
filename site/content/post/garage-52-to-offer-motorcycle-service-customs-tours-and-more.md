<p style="color: #505b67;">Hidden in a small lane at the edge of Bandra in the Chuim Village is a new establishment called Garage 52, the Moto Collective. Garage 52 intends to be a space where you can have your motorcycle fixed, turned into a custom, rent a workbench for a spot of DIY and much more. Garage 52 is the new home of <a style="color: #d82b2f;" href="https://jcmoto.in/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">jcMoto</a>, our favourite motorcycle custom outfit (read more about their work <a style="color: #d82b2f;" title="JCMoto Sun Chaser first ride" href="https://overdrive.in/features/jcmoto-sun-chaser-first-ride/" target="_blank">RD350 Sunchaser first ride</a> and <a style="color: #d82b2f;" title="A custom-made Honda CD125T tracker" href="https://overdrive.in/features/a-custom-made-honda-cd125t-tracker/" target="_blank">Honda tracker first ride</a>) run by ex-journalist, certified pilot and complete motorhead Joshua Crasto.</p>

<p style="color: #505b67;">Garage 52 brings together, effectively, a great mechanic, a fantastic custom builder and one of India’s top motorcycle touring outfits. The Garage also intends to expand their services further including renting motorcycle and space to park a motorcycle when you’re travelling and need to park in a safe place for the duration.</p>
<p style="color: #505b67;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6509" src="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Garage-52-2.jpg?resize=586%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Garage-52-2" width="586" height="400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Garage-52-2.jpg?w=586&amp;ssl=1 586w, https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Garage-52-2.jpg?resize=500%2C341&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="color: #505b67;">jcMoto will also offer a workbench that you can rent by the hour. This is very interesting because the rental includes all the tools in the garage as well as the expertise of all the various stars of Garage 52. If you’ve always wanted to do DIY, we cannot think of a better way to get started. Garage 52 also plans to do other things. The plans includes talks, video shows and more over the weekend.</p>
<p style="color: #505b67;">Garage 52 is located near 58, Chuim Village Rd, Chuim Village, Danda, Pali Hill Mumbai, Maharashtra 400052 <a style="color: #d82b2f;" href="httpss://www.google.com/maps/preview?q=19.074631,72.825808&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;source=newuser-ws" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/maps/VZwPH</a></p>
