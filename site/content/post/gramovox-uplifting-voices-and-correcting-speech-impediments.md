GramoVox is a devised discipline of vocal and speech education founded by Graham D’Souza. GramoVox was founded in 2013 with the sole purpose of Uplifting Voices and correcting speech impediments. The unique element about GramoVox is that it deals with and oversees every aspect of the “Spoken” human voice. The subjects of specialisation include Voice Modulation, Public Speaking, Speech Therapy and The Linguistics of English. Since the ground for all work at GramoVox is practiced upon quality literature, the subject of Composition, Spoken Verse and Metrics in Poetry are taught too. Over these seven and a half years, students and professionals of varying age and industry have flourished under the direction of Graham and his incessant drive to empower the voice of humankind. At GramoVox, there is no room for discouragement or negativity – just pragmatic criticism which is purely constructive. Here, it is all about helping, educating and curing voices through Reformed Vocal Guidance.
