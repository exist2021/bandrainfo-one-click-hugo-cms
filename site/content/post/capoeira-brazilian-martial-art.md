<p>Capoeira is a Brazilian martial art that is currently practiced all over the world. While its origins are the subject of much debate, it has evolved from an underground activity associated with criminals to its legalization and subsequent popularization and on to becoming a national sport.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/capoiera-logo.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1831 alignright" alt="capoiera logo" src="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/capoiera-logo.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/capoiera-logo.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/capoiera-logo.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Capoeira as a sport is played in several different ways, the two most common being Angola and Regional. In both there are defense and attack moves that are accompanied and even led by the music and songs that the Master (Mestre) and students play and sing. Distinctive from other martial arts by this music, the continuous movement of the players and the minimal contact involved it is often (mis)taken for a dance. However, let not the grace and flexibility of the players hide their strength and skill.</p>
<p>With the foundation of the Paulista Federation of Capoeira in 1974,the Brazilian art went on to acquire more and more space in society. It grew so much that today the Cordao de Ouro group has thousands of members spread around the world, including the United States, France, Israel, Japan, Austria, Portugal, Mexico, England, Italy and India.</p>
<p>In India Capoeira has been introduced through Instrutor Baba (Reza Massah). He studied Capoeira for six years with the Cordão de Ouro (CDO) group in Israel. (CDO was started by Mestre Suassuna in Sao Paulo, Brazil and has branches all over the world).</p>

<p>Classes were begun in Mumbai in March 2006 with the classes typically having between 30 to 50 students per month, including 10% foreign students.</p>
<p>The multiple aspects of Capoeira from the physical (weight regulation, flexibility and acrobatic movements) to the musical (the instruments and songs) and cultural (language) make it a sport that appeals to a wide segment. Indeed, all over the world, people of all ages, men, women and children are making it a part of their routines.</p>
<p>From the Favelas of Brazil to the rest of the world, Capoeira offers an outlet for children. Parents all across the globe realize the positive impact it has had on their kids, increasing their self-confidence, mental sharpness and physical fitness levels. In India, Baba is teaching the kids the lessons of life, through Capoeira.</p>
