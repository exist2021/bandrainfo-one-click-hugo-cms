Most of the coffeeshops have scooted in face of competition from Starbucks. One such coffeeshop to shut shop last year was CBTL (Cafe Bean Tea Leaf). Now the place is occupied by TRUPTI, which is the Indian Brand. This is its 3rd outlet in Mumbai. The first one was established in 1964 at VP Road in Sobo, they have a second outlet at Lower parel. This is not in anyway related or associated with another Trupti which is very well known in Khar.</p>
<h1>Popular Indian Snacks</h1>
<p>Trupti serves popular Indian snacks like Dahi Vada, Aloo Tikki, Mungdal chilla, Chole Batura, Samosa chaat, pav bhaji, sev puri, batata wada, Kothmir Vadi, khandvi, various variations of Dhokla and the works etc. There are some specialities like Dal Pakwan, Dal Khichoi. All priced at around 140-160. For the sweet toothed they have Stuffed Gulab Jamun, Rasmalai, jalebi and Cream Rolls.</p>
<h2>Service</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_6501.jpg?resize=200%2C220&#038;ssl=1" align="right" width="200" height="220" class="alignright" data-recalc-dims="1">I am thrilled about an Indian brand taking this place. However, I am afraid of the Indian service. The khulad tea served to me was cold. On complaining I was not offered a replacement, which is the norm at places like Starbucks. This kind of service really puts me off. After all the Khullad tea cost Rs 90/- and a replacement should be offered as basic courtesy.</p>
<p>I hope the service doesnâ€™t disappoint anyone else.</p>
