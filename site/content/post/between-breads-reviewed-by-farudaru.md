<p>This place oozes fun and casual. It&#8217;s perfect for that &#8216;I need to munch on something&#8217; feeling.</p>
<p>They do have quite a decent selection of stuff that&#8217;s &#8220;between breads&#8221; which includes Burgers, Hot Dogs, Sandwiches and delicious munchies like Bacon Fries &amp; Jalapeno Poppers to go with your order.</p>
<p>I love the cute burger buns decor on the walls. The seating is a tad uncomfy on those high stools. So it&#8217;s definitely an eat &amp; go type place, rather than a sit down. (Wooden stools with a high back might be better)</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re waiting for that delicious burger of yours, you&#8217;ve got peppy music and Archies comics to keep you entertained. And of course, you can chat up the cute friendly guys who own the place.</p>
<p>Their prices definitely surprised me, I was expecting it to be in the Burgs range, but this place has awesome value-for-money comfort food.</p>
<p>BB special fries is the way to go. Crispy Fried Potatoes topped with caramelized onions, gooey cheese and thousand island sauce. Damn! I want some right naowwww!!</p>
<p>Just a quick suggestion, it does get a little hot and smoky in there, maybe a better ventilation system and one more ac might help. And also the Beef patty need to be a little more flavourful.</p>
<p>MUST HAVE:<br />
1) Beef Cheese burger<br />
2) BB style fries<br />
3) Onion Rings<br />
4) Pink Lemonade</p>
<p>I&#8217;m definitely going back there at the earliest!</p>
<p>And you should too! Happy Eating! ðŸ™‚</p>
