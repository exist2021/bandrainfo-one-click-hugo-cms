<p>In the early 60’s,The Middle Income Group (MIG) Colony was created in Bandra (East). The land was reclaimed land and had water logged pockets all around the colony. As the colony came to be established the sports enthusiasts of the colony started “The MIG Sports Club” in order to provide recreational facilities for the residents of MIG Colony.</p>
<p>However, the young cricket enthusiasts of the club had visions of growth and decided to accommodate the sportsmen from neighbouring colonies also. This gave birth to the MIG Cricket Club. The popularity of the game and sincerity of the young cricketers laid a strong foundation for the upcoming institution. The guidance provided by cricket lovers of the MIG Colony like Shri. K. D. Potdar, Shri. Raj Kaul, Shri. V. M. Madge, Late V. D. Suvarna gave a lead to young Gen-Secretary of the Club, Shri. Pravin R. Barve, to take the club from strength to strength with dedicated supporters, like Shri. P.N. Parsekar and others.</p>
<p>On 5thJuly 1981 a humble beginning was made when the cricketing legend Padmashri “Polly Umrigar”, laid the foundation stone of the first cricket pavilion of the club.The club, after its registration as a Public Trust in 1978, was turned into a smart recreation center with a beautiful playground and an attached pavilion and a small garden restaurant. Later on, a permit-room was added to the facilities. The open air “Players Corner” restaurant of the Club became one of the most popular eating and meeting place for members and their guests.</p>
<p>The club management undertook a massive expansion programme of the present Sports Complex and dream of the people at the helm of the club turned into reality. The foundation stone of the new complex was laid on 16th of May, 1991 and in 1992, the club acquired a proper playground of almost 14000 sq mtrs for playing cricket.</p>
<p>The MIG Cricket Club is today one of the foremost cricket clubs in the city of Mumbai and plays in the &#8216;A&#8217; division of the Dr. H. D. Kanga League. The Club has also won the Kanga League &#8216;A&#8217; division title 3 times besides other tournaments.</p>
<p>The latest twin facilities of a Gymnasium/Health Club, and a swimming pool were added. The dressing rooms for cricketers were improved and became one of the best dressing rooms in the city Clubs. Facilities like a state of art restaurant and five star rooms were added. The Club also developed facilities for playing Badminton, Table Tennis, Chess and Billiards &amp; Snooker.</p>
