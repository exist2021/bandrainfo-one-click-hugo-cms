<p>Inheritance, a unique place that caters to people who are tired of shopping at generic stores that look and feel the same. We believe that it&#8217;s the little things that matter, hence every product whether it&#8217;s the delicately handcrafted products or the exclusive Inheritance products; you are assured of the finest.</p>
<p>Good living and good gifting that&#8217;s Inheritance. The products are fresh and intriguing rather than trendy and tired. There is so much to be inspired by and so much to experience.</p>
<p>Inheritance offers everything &#8220;different&#8221;. Mostly Indian, though Inheritance is expanding beyond India to include South East Asian handcrafted pieces. Inheritance encourages its buyers to mix into less expensive pieces too.</p>
