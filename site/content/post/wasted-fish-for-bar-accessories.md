<p>Ever dreamed of swimming in a free pool of alcohol?? Well, when you wake up you can probably realize that, it’s not what we offer.</p>
<p>Make WASTED FISH a part of your drinking scenario and well, get super wasted!!</p>
<p>INTRIGUED?? CONFUSED?? WANT TO KNOW MORE??</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasted Fish&#8221; is run by two drinking mavens, Chandni Shahani &amp; Imran Rizvi, who were looking to make their drinking experience, a little more enjoyable. The idea was conceived, since it seemed criminal every time they poured the alcohol out of the impeccably designed bottles, into the same banal barware, which in no way reflected their personalities. They decided to sober up, if only momentarily, and get all their artist friends together, to help design unique, quirky, some might say peculiar shot glasses, and it didn&#8217;t stop there.</p>
<p>They ran the gamut from upscale wine glasses and decanters to ashtrays and even matchboxes, to come up with a range that’s individualistic, and unlike anything ones seen before in their uncle&#8217;s stuffy bar. Despite having an efficient management team, and a more than capable design team, they stay involved in every aspect of the organization, to ensure that their customers have an enjoyable shopping experience with Wasted Fish.</p>
<p>Wasted Fish also undertakes bulk orders, or customized party orders, and we will do all we can to fulfill your requests.</p>
<p>Oh, and for those of you that don&#8217;t bother pouring drinks into a glass, they&#8217;ve got drinking games too!</p>
