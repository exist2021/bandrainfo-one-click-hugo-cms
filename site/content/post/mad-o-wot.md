<p>A sneak peek into her Mad-o-wot  list would reveal names of celebrity clients like Priyanka Chopra, Katrina Kaif, Hrithik Roshan, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Virat Kohli, Siddharth Mallya, Mandira Bedi, John Abraham among others.</p>
<p>Her team at Mad-o-wot has no pretensions and has a frank and honest attitude just like her. The down-to-earth stylists offer the best hair-do you must have had in a long while and can also create the most memorable runway looks of the season.</p>
