But Bandra people given the space constraints do their best to keep the art scene thriving in the suburbs. If you crave for art then you don&#39;t have to go all the way to Sobo for some art, as Bandra is becoming the hive of a buzzing art scene. Also with the expected opening of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bombay-arts-society-prepares-to-open-soon-at-bandra-reclamation/">Bombay Art Society</a> in Bandra which is over due in April, expect Bandra to take lead in the art scene in Mumbai.</p>

My favorite here is Jashn E Qalam reading of Hindi contemporary literature by some extremely talented theatre people. Also they have a movie screening and talk curated by Roshan Sabharwal called the Fourth Wall.</p>

Well its on 28th Road, next to a Mickey Mehta Gym. Bandra base is another super place, they have Jazz Music almost every weekends. They invite visiting artist from abroad to perform quite impromtu, also they have Salsa classes which goes on there. Another thing which i love there is the <a href="https://www.cineplay.com/">cineplay</a> screening. Its wonderful to see a cineplay with about 20 people. If you need your Jazz fix and cannot travel all the way to NCPA this is the place to be.</p>

Mcubed regularly invites authors and distinguished guests for talks and discussions as well they have movie screenings and curated events for young kids. A super place to meet old time bandra people. One of my favorite place to go and soak in some knowledge. They also host <a href="https://www.junoontheatre.org/index.php">Junoon Theatre</a> every 1st Saturday of the month.</p>

Its based out of St. Paul media institute building and also has a small coffee shop. They dont have regular events, but do host some book launch events. Its probably the biggest library in bandra. Only wished they would do more events and book readings or host a book club.</p>

(WAA) &#8211; </strong>I have attended only one event of WAA, it is housed in the same building as bandra base and last week there was bandra based artist <a href="https://www.reenakallat.com/">Reena Saini Kallat</a>. Reena presented a AV of her works since 2002 with introduction to all her wonderful works. I look forward to more events here.</p>
