<p>Jolly Juniors was the brainchild of the Mendonca’s. Their goal was to provide space to preschool children with a difference.Jolly Juniors provides an atmosphere with natural surroundings under the shade of trees, where preschool education is provided through play and fun. Children learn at their own pace in a relaxed atmosphere by observing nature, playing and chatting with each other and singing songs and reciting nursery rhymes. We believe in good teaching practices by promoting learning through play.</p>
<p>All play activities and resources are designed to meet the individual needs of your child. We offer children the opportunity to investigate and explore the manmade and natural world around them, to extend their fine and gross motor skills and to express their own ideas and feelings. We encourage children to enjoy drawing, painting and books and appreciate the meaning they carry. Through carefully planned activities we will encourage children to improve their vocabulary, to listen, talk and respond as well as to develop writing and literary skills.</p>
<p>We also encourage children to work and play, and to cooperate independently in group situations. Children are taught to respect all living things to their full potential and all children are treated equally with love and respect, irrespective of their religion, caste or creed.</p>
<p><b>Objectives</b></p>
<p>The aim of Jolly Juniors is to provide the highest standards of professional care and education, in a natural, happy, safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>We fully acknowledge parents as the primary educators of their children, hence we insist on working in partnership with parents for the benefit of their child. The playschool operates on an open door policy. Parents are welcome to visit and be involved with the school whenever they wish to. Jolly Juniors has certain policy documents which parents must read and be aware of.</p>
<p>We at Jolly Juniors desire that school time be an extension of the home and we achieve this by providing</p>
<p>(1) A warm stable environment, with caring, friendly staff;</p>
<p>(2) Showing our affection towards children through cuddles, hugs, laughter, stories &amp; songs;</p>
<p>(3) Being flexible &amp; spontaneous by respecting the child’s needs and not expecting them to fit into a rigid program;</p>
<p>(4) Encouraging various age groups to freely mix together. However, the children are divided into groups for group time, so that they experience activities at</p>
<p>their own level of understanding.</p>
<p>In this manner we hope to achieve our motto, <b>“SMART START.”</b></p>
