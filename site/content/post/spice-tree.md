<p>Nestled at the end of Hill Road, close to St. Andrews Church, away from the hustle and bustle of commercial street traffic is Spice Tree – a fine dining restaurant and bar. As the name suggests, Spice Tree endeavours to create the most exclusive dining experience with the accent on the use of authentic spices for you.</p>
<p>The restaurant spread over an area of 3000 sq. ft retains the old world charm of the original villa with its high ceiling and old teak rafters and the plush interiors in warm tones will put you at ease the moment you step in. The special Goan, Malvani and Konkani food besides the regular Indian fare will leave your palate tingling for a long time.</p>
<p>We at Spice Tree believe only the optimum use of very authentic spices can produce a complete and exclusive eating experience.</p>
<p>The aromatic ambience at Spice Tree also incorporates a well stocked and stylish bar which is a total mood setter and will ensure that you are kept in high spirits.</p>
<p>Spice Tree is the perfect place for a relaxed meal with friends and colleagues, kitty parties,birthday celebrations, private get togethers. It is also an excellent venue for meetings with clients over food and drinks, banquet functions and company events.</p>
