<p><b><i>By Anurima Das</i></b></p>
<p>Grace. Poise. Class. And a little dollop of style, you are ready to be the show stopper every day. Yes! Dolling up to a celeb like avatar with the perfect indulgence of style and fashion is no more just a farfetched thought but an everyday affair!</p>
<p>What began in 2005 as an interest and a solution to feed up the need gap for something branded, in an affordable price is today a grown up. Shilpa Bhatia’s brain child The Clothing Rental is all set to begin its teenage years soon, but maturity wise this child has surely grown too big, as compared to its age.</p>
<p><a href="httpss://www.theclothingrental.com">The Clothing Rental</a> today operates from two stylish nooks at Versova and Bandra, which are solely preserved for your high fashion needs. But it is just not another store that sells premium clothing with an even more premier tag. Just like its name, this store simply allows you to pick your choice from a wardrobe full of high fashion. Yes! You heard it right. And the tag takes a backseat even when you rent the costliest and the most premium picks from brands like Terani Couture, Valentino, Ash Couture, Jovani etc.</p>

<p>Every little corner at the high-ceilinged address of The Clothing Rental breathes a classy flavor, which is bound to transcend you on to the red carpet or take you on that yacht of your dream, which you would possibly book for that cozy private vacation. Wow! Walking on the long red carpet road in a Valentino latest collection sequined gown or wearing those flowy summer gowns for your next vacation. And these are all possible by not buying those exclusive, expensive designer pieces.</p>
<p>That’s what the stylists do, that’s what your favourite’s from Bollywood do, to look like a ‘Diva’. Walking through the store, feels like walking into a secretly preserved designer wardrobe that hushes sweet memories into your ears and brings that smile, and you just want to try everything and find reasons to actually fit into those exquisite wonders.</p>
<p>Colours are a riot at <a href="httpss://www.theclothingrental.com">The Clothing Rental</a>, and will pull you towards them and will only make you satiate for more as you touch and sort those endless pieces from Marchesa, Jenny Yoo, Carmen Marc Valvo, Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Badgley Mischka. And if you hold a special place for Indian designers in your heart, then do try those couture creations from Payal Singhal and Manish Malhotra too.</p>
<p>But be prepared to be spoilt for choice, as every creation at <a href="httpss://www.theclothingrental.com">The Clothing Rental</a> is special and has been handpicked over the years by Shilpa, quite fondly. She has a special eye for exclusivity and branded has always meant class for her, be it the Indian couture or the Western ensembles that she hangs with honour at her little cradle of high fashion.</p>
