I am amazed at Kashmira's doodle art on her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kashewdoodle/), So i asked her why does she have only one thousand follower's? She said, she only created the account in May 2020 when she finally got her Ipad and pencil which motivated her to get into digital doodling.

She is a multi-talented person being a professional physiotherapist and a doodler. Also if you read her interview below, you will also think of her as a good story teller. Her art is generally bright and cheery and there is something motivational and inspirational in pandemic times when our stress levels are high on Instagram due to FOMO and non-stop aspirational messaging by brands using influencers. Highly recommend you follow her to reduce your anxiety levels.

Read Kashmira Sequeira's unique insights about growing up and living in Bandra East in the interview.

## Can you introduce yourself and your art?

Hey hey, I’m Kashmira, I’m a 24year old physiotherapist working a 9-5 job and a passionate quirky doodle artist all the other hours of the day! My artwork usually presents quirky yet thoughtful messages and a few funny events from my day! With the way 2020 has presented itself, I just intend on creating that one happy post that would lighten up your day! amongst all the disappointing things happening around us currently. According to me Cartooning and doodling digitally have the biggest advantage since you save on a lot of paper, pens, paints etc..so that’s my little way of doing my bit for our planet.

## How is it living in BANDRA East? How long have you lived there?

Every time someone asks me where I’m from I say “Bandra” and they go like “oh Woah so cool fancy people huh..do you live near hill road or linking road? Which Bollywood star do u live close to?” And id just giggle awkwardly and say,” oh no I live on the EAST! “ And no one knew what on earth that was.

Growing up Bandra East wasn’t as developed as it is today. We had this lush beautiful canopy of trees through the lanes. When you’d enter the East via kalanagar the temperature would always drop by 1-2degrees. And the air was always cleaner. I’ve lived here all my life and it’s only In the last 6-7years that most buildings have gone into redevelopment and now we have these high rise towers and all sorts of restaurants and roads linking us to BKC (Bandra Karla complex). So finally the East is picking up the pace and being as accessible as the west..hehe

## What are some favourite places to shop, eat, hang out in Bandra east

If you ask me places from my childhood (when things weren’t developed as much) my favourite place to eat **Bhel & Chat was “[Guptas](https://www.zomato.com/mumbai/guptas-snackhub-bandra-east)”** his stall stands opposite jade gardens and is on the main road. I’ve practically influenced all my Chembur, Ghatkopar, Kalina friends into coming all the way just to eat from his stall(Guilty!) hehe.

The other super tiny stall that anyone would miss is **“[Patil vada pav](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//patil+vada+pav+bandra+east/data=!4m6!4m5!1m1!4e2!1m2!1m1!1s0x3be7c91e4fd9de15:0x733f12f01dfd3655?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi844egoontAhVC7nMBHZPlAUQQ9RcwO3oECDYQAw)”** during my school days we’d save our pocket money or rickshaw money just to go eat vada pav and Bhajji pav from his shop. After all the redevelopment that has happened the places I’d like to hang out at is craft bar it’s quite close by so Incase u don’t want to spend time travelling it’s the closest to home and it’s got a chilled vibe.

## Tell us a secret about Bandra east? Or peculiarities?

Honestly, I don’t think Bandra east has any secrets that I’m aware of haha.. but umm a little story my grandmom would tell me is that Bandra east and bkc was previously all mushy land and mangroves and people would go from one place to another on boats. As a child, I believed the authenticity of that story a 100% and as an artist, I’d like to imagine how adventurous that would have been back in the day! Hehe!

Also, One thing I always associate with my Bandra east memories is this small shop by A very dear uncle we’d all call “Arun Mama” he had a small shop that sold eggs, bread, chocolates, cold drinks and soaps, brushes and all things random. But he had such a big heart and every Diwali, Christmas, birthday etc he would give all the kids chocolate and cold-drink for free! And he would insist saying that makes him happy seeing us happy! And that's not it.. he would also cook food everyday and feed over 20 cats in his neighbourhood even though he struggled financially too! And as a child witnessing this selfless act of kindness has probably played an integral part of who I am today! **Striving to make someone smile and hopefully make the world a happier and kinder place, one cartoon at a time!**
