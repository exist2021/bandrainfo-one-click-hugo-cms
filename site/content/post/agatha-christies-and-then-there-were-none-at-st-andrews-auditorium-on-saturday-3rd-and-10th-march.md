<p dir="ltr"><strong>By Manju Sampat</strong></p>
<p>Making Noise&#8217;, a relatively new and exciting theatre group, is bringing an all time classic production to the Mumbai Stage. They are performing Agatha Christie&#8217;s &#8216;<strong>AND THEN THERE WERE NONE</strong>&#8216; at St. Andrews Auditorium on Saturday March 3rd and 10th at 7.30 pm.</p>
<p>The play is based on one of the most exciting and engaging story telling formats in any art form, the murder mystery. And Then There Were None, is a 1943 play by crime writer Agatha Christie. The play, like the 1939 book on which it is based, was originally titled and performed in the UK as Ten Little Niggers. It was also performed under the name Ten Little Indians.<br />
Agatha Christie has described this masterpiece as the most difficult of her books to write. A mystery that will keep you at the edge of your<br />
seats – ‘<strong>AND THEN THERE WERE NONE</strong>’.</p>
<p>&#8216;Ten&#8230;&#8217;Ten strangers are lured to an island mansion off the Devon coast. Over dinner, an unseen voice accuses each of them of harbouring a guilty secret, and by the end of the evening one of their number is dead.</p>

<p>&#8216;Nine&#8230;&#8217;Their host fails to appear, and as the weather changes the island becomes a sinister and claustrophobic place to be stranded.<br />
&#8216;Eight&#8230;&#8217;Haunted by an ancient nursery rhyme, they all realise that the murderer is not only among them but is preparing to strike again.<br />
&#8216;Seven&#8217;The tension escalates as the survivors try to keep one step ahead of their ingenious stalker, who seems bent on reaching the final line –<br />
&#8216;And Then There Were None.&#8217;<br />
One of Christie’s darkest tales and a masterpiece of dramatic construction, its growing sense of dread and unfaltering tension will keep you guessing to the very end.</p>
<p>This play is directed by Laura Mishra, a professional theatre actor, and it stars Tanmay Ranjan, Abhishek Chakrobarty, Prerna Talwar and others. A not to be missed show as it holds a lot of promise and excitement.</p>
