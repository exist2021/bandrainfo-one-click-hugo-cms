<p>People are affected by your appearance whether or not they realize it, and whether or not they think appearance is important.&#8221;</p>
<p>You probably know from personal experience how much more respect you receive from store clerks when you are well dressed.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t yet experienced this, try an experiment. Go shopping at a designer boutique dressed in casual home clothes then visit the same boutique looking well groomed and wearing your best outfit. Observe how you are, treated by the staff, as well as anyone else you encounter, in both situations.</p>
<p>Appearance and image has an impact on our professional lives as well. Well dressed and groomed people are perceived as authoritative, trustworthy, intelligent, successful and suitable for hire or promotion.</p>
