<p>Shubhangi and all of the artists at Rising DragonTattoo Studio are backed by years of experience and they combine knowledge, precision and the best materials to craft our distinctive equipments and offer services that yield improvements in a tattooist.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves in the superiority of our tattoo designs. If you have an idea in your head, we can bring it to life with our art.</p>
<p>Bandra resident Shubhangi Ghodke started Rising Dragon Tattoo  before which she worked as a tattoo artist from home. Once again, the space is tiny, with a single chair in the corner from which she and her 2 other artists work. One of the walls is papered with sketches and pictures of previously done tattoos.</p>
<p>Superhero action figures line a shelf, sticking to what seems to be the prerequisite decor for Bandra tattoo parlours.</p>
<p>Shubhangi provides a positive work experience for herself and her clients. Rising Dragon Tattoo Studio has been giving the best of art design for the clients in tinsel town of Mumbai West in Bandra.</p>
