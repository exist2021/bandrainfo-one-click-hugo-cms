<p>Our vision is to develop a sustainable creative eco-system for Indian Graphic Artists to have their work seen, discussed, appreciated – and monetized. We just couldn’t bear to see so much brilliant work forever hidden in their sketchbooks, computers and wonderfully divergent minds.</p>
<p>We curate established and emerging talented artists and mentor younger ones. And continue to search for new talents that represent the most unique, sophisticated and promising work.</p>
<p>We provide themes, select the best works and print them on premium Kulture Shop products for sale. Art prints and art tees for now but, in time, other lifestyle products. Artists are compensated per piece sold, so for every one bought, an Indian Graphic Artist is rewarded for their work.</p>

<p>Art changes the way we experience a space. It gives it an identity, a character, a memory.</p>
