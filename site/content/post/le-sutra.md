<p>Sutra in Sanskrit is a &#8216;rope or thread that holds things together&#8217;.</p>
<p>At Le Sutra we&#8217;ve tried to weave thousands of years of Indian ethos and narrate it through contemporary Indian Art.</p>
<p>We gave ourselves a brief to take a small hotel nestled in one of the most vibrant streets in Mumbai and make it as significant as any other in the world – truly a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Fired by the concept, several artists, designers, curators, philosophers and visualizers were inspired to take on the challenge. What followed was a tomb of research and the team applying head and heart, amongst many works, rejections and re-works created Le Sutra – the world&#8217;s first Indian Art Hotel..</p>
<p>Taking from a palette of philosophy, myth, art form, and historic pride, it turned out to be quite a journey as we delved across time in our search of the illusive Indian-ness.</p>

<p>The three levels of the Hotel represent the Gunas which sum up worldview in Indian philosophy. Gunas are tendencies and attributes that exist within people, nature and things; their thoughts and emotions, so essential to the evolution of consciousness. It&#8217;s a way of qualifying objects &#8211; an artifact or a being.</p>
<p>The reception is based on the concept of the &#8216;kundalini&#8217;.</p>
<p>The lift is based on the &#8216;chakras&#8217;.</p>
<p><b>Art at Le Sutra</b></p>
<p>The 16 rooms at Le Sutra are based on &#8216;characters&#8217; (Ravana, Ashoka, Buddha) or &#8216;characteristics&#8217; (sensuality, love, purification) inspired by Indian mythos.</p>
<p>Every room is a virtual canvas where the story forms the guest experience. It is subtly composed through art &#8211; paintings, artifacts, chairs, inlays and sculptures; narrating their part, showcasing diverse themes and philosophies.</p>
