<p class="p1">This is an ancient technique common to the entire Himalayan belt and South eastern culture (including Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nepal though the material used in the bowls, and the techniques, may vary). Today however it is more commonly referred to as the Tibetan singing bowl meditation. It is an ancient tribal healing method, but is now ascribed to Buddhism since it has been fervently adopted by the latter and thrives in these cultures where it is prominent.</p>
<p class="p1">It is actually a sound massage, using the overtones (beyond the dominant note) of each bowl. These overtones, though bypassed by the rational mind, is &#8220;caught&#8221; by the subconscious which is more fine-tuned such subtle experiences. It induces a deep trance state, where the Beta electrical wave pattern (normal to the waking mind) shifts into the meditative Alpha mode (second stage of brain wave pattern where the mind is both rested and alert). It is an exciting way to shut down the reticulating activating system of the brain(which creates the inner static and chatter of the mind, linked to stress) and heal us by inducing a deep relaxation. Those who have experienced are wowed by the fact that without any contact of hands, and purely through the overtone sounds induced by the struck bowls, a relaxation that is very deep, akin to that of any massage, is experienced. In the style I have trained in,  seven bowls are used (aligned with the seven chakras &#8212; which may be comparable to the endocrine map of the body). Each bowl is picked because it has a dominantmusical note (as in the western/Indian classical musical scale). This note can be gauged by any electronic tuner. This method is for an individual. Another technique which is used for group meditation involves stroking the bowl to evoke a sound that is referred lovingly by Tibetan monks as the sound of the &#8220;void&#8221; or a prolonged Om.</p>

I am trained and certified by him to use a specially selected set of bowls to initiate this meditative and healing experience. Though singing bowls are common, those used in such therapies are different because they are said to be created through the right amalgamation of seven metals.</p>
