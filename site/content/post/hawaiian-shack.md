<p>The success of Hawaiian Shack demonstrates that we have built an emotional connection with our customers. We have a competitive advantage over other companies. Our people do a wonderful job of knowing your drink, your name, and your kids name too. Hawaiian Shacks directors and managers understand the importance of this personal connection, and how the efforts spark business, they exert a creative and passionate energy that gets notices by customers.</p>
<p>Expectations and service is one of the main principles of Shack. The shack experience and environment is as important as a glass of drink with new upcoming events and gigs held frequently where in we serve complementary shots. At times the beer rates fall to 5 Rupees or sometimes even 50 paisa. You got to see it to believe it!</p>
