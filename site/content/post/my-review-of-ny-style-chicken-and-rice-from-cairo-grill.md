<p> <a href="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_8082.jpg?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_8082.jpg?w=850&#038;ssl=1" id="blogsy-1430907919185.1616" class="" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></a> Too lazy to cook my lunch today, I decided to order NY Style chicken and rice from Cairo Grill. Having never been to NY I was curious to know what New Yorkers eat. In spite of having read a couple of reviews which claimed the this was not so authentic NY style chicken and rice, I decided that i should atleast risk it for once.</p>
<p>My order arrived after more than 45 mins, the delivery guy explaining that one guy hasn&#39;t turned up. Getting to the dish, it looked kind of ok, but the presentation was not that bad too. I dug in earnestly as it was already late. A few bites and I was pleased at the generous amount to grilled chicken boneless peices, but gradually the meal was just not ending, after finishing about 30% of the dish, I was wondering should I put in the refrigerator for the evening meal, I was now totally bored with the meal, and was playing around and just digging the chicken peices which we plenty.</p>
<p>The rice underneath the labneh (I guess) dressing is red in color. The rice was insipid and lacked inspiration. I added the extra labneh and sauces sent to me, but still the dish was not going down my throat, finally midway I abandoned the dish and it went straight to the dustbin.</p>
<p>Please note, the writer has weak digestive system and is a small eater. If you need something really filling and you are big eater, this is the dish for you. I bet it is sufficient for one.</p>
<p>Cairo grill launched with lot of buzz on social media and eventually the buzz seems to have died down, how long do they survive in a competitive and discerning Bandra suburb is something to watch out.</p>
