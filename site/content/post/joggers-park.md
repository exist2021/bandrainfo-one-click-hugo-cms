<p>Standing on the shores of the Arabian Sea, is an admirably clean seaside jogging track, possibly one of the best in Mumbai. The Joggers Park as it is aptly named provides a landmark element for Bandra.</p>
<p>One of the best maintained public parks in Mumbai, the lush green Joggers Park project and initiative opened in 1990 is a gift from Sir Oliver Andrade.</p>
<p>Located strategically next to the Otters Club and the Laughing Club, Joggers Park is an instant vibe change from the buzz of Bandra.</p>
