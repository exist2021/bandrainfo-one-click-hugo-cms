<p dir="auto">Started in 2012 by revered international street artist Ranjit Dahiya, the Bollywood Art Project or BAP transforms the walls of Bombay into a living memorial to Bollywood. Creating larger-than-life murals of Bollywood legends, the BAP pays homage to the cultural icons of the city’s glorious film industry. In many ways, it is our own version of the ‘Hollywood Walk of Fame’. Adorning many a walls of Bandra, let’s take a closer look at the stars and their iconic portraits.</p>

<h3>Anarkali</h3>
<p>Located near Duke’s restaurant on Chapel Road, this 23 feet high mural of Anarkali and her lover marked the very beginning of the BAP. Touted as one of the most influential films in the history of Bollywood, ‘Mughal-E-Azam’ had a huge impact on Indian Cinema. Cult as we call it, the film spawned many iconic fashion trends that have revolutionised the ethnic fashion of today.</p>

<h3>Amitabh Bachchan</h3>
<p>The angry young man of Bollywood adorns the walls of a small bungalow near the Mehboob Studio, striking an image that is peculiarly Amitabh Bachchan! Sporting the look of a man who is poised, but equally ready to fight &#8211; this mural attracts plenty of visitors through the day. This deevar will never be the same again!</p>

<h3>Rajesh Khanna</h3>
<p>Shortly after completing the Amitabh Bachchan mural, the world heard the sad demise of Bollywood’s original superstar. And rightly so, Ranjit set out to bring him alive through his creation. One can spot this effervescent imagery in Ranwar Village, adjacent to Amitabh’s mural. Touted as one of his best works, it seems as if the legend is looking straight at you while you cross by.</p>

<h3>Dadasaheb Phalke</h3>
<p>The 126 ft high MTNL building on Bandra Reclamation is today popularly called the bright yellow building &#8211; thanks to this beautiful masterpiece of ‘The Father of Indian Cinema’! A collaborative effort between Ranjit and the St+art Project (Delhi), this mural was completed within 10 days. Often the first sight that captures your eye whilst you enter Bandra, this creation is nothing short of iconic.</p>
<h3>Nawazuddin Siddiqi</h3>
<p>Based on the movie, Manjhi &#8211; The Mountain Man, this is the only contemporary creation of Ranjit. Bang opposite the restaurant Imbiss on Waroda Road, this mural is beautiful play on colours. Based on a true story, Nawazuddin plays a man from Bihar who breaks through a dangerous mountain using just a chisel and a hammer!</p>
<h3>Amrish Puri</h3>
<p>One of Bollywood’s most iconic villains, Amrish Puri was and will always continue to be an enigma. A character which he effortlessly essayed, Ranjit created the hugely popular Mogambo mural right behind the Gulab Nagar Society near Khar Danda. With wide eyes and the iconic gold and black outfit, this mural is sure to make you utter ‘Mogambo khush hua’ under your breath!</p>

<h3>Madhubala</h3>
<p>One of Bollywood’s evergreen queen and lady heartthrob, Madhubala sports her signature seductive smile in this mural. Painted right next to the Anarkali creation, this creation is taken straight out of her portrayal in Barsaat ki Raat. You will often spot visitors stopping by for a selfie with Bollywood’s original leading lady!</p>
