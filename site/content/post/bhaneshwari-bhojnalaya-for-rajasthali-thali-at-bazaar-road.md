<p dir="auto">I was thinking of shifting to Mahim because of the exorbitant price of basic food in Bandra. On a random request on Twitter, Raju Katira told me to check out this place.</p>

<p>I called them to check if they delivered home via swiggy. The owner hasn&#8217;t even heard about swiggy. He said if you eat here it will cost Rs 80 and for takeaways the cost is Rs 90/- .</p>
<p>I decided to head out as I need some exercise and warm sunlight. Finding the place is quite a challenge, but there is a landmark called &#8220;Dr Praveen Chopra&#8221; or just say &#8220;Chopra House&#8221;.</p>
<p>You got to sit on the floor and a towel is given to wipe the dust off the plates, the plates were squeaky clean and really I thought the towel was unnecessary. But on being stared, I wiped the plates. After this two servers come and serve you. The food was delicious and bit spicy, but delivious. There was a sabji made of green chillies which was amazing.</p>
<p>So the roti&#8217;s seemed to unlimited and I didn&#8217;t check if this is an unlimited thali. I eat very light.</p>
<p>Note &#8211; They are open from 12 pm to 2.30 pm and evening from 8 pm to 10.30 pm. They are only closed on Sunday evenings.</p>
<p>PS &#8211; Check out the some beautiful (but dilapidated ) old houses on your walk there</p>
