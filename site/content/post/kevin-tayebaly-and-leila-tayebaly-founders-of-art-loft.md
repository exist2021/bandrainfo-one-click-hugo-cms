<p>The Tayebaly siblings, who are half Gujarati and half French, lived in countries as diverse as Reunion Island and China before settling in Mumbai.</p>
<p>&#8220;My sister Leïla worked as an arts therapist in Beijing and Paris and also managed an atelier there,&#8221; says Kevin. &#8220;After her husband was posted in India with a French company three years ago, she started offering art therapy classes in her home before opening the <a href="https://www.theartloft.co.in/" target="_blank">Art Loft</a> in April 2009. A month after the Art Loft opened, I quit my job at CapGemini to work with her full time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Tayebaly&#8217;s, who were behind the <a href="https://www.theartloft.co.in/act/" target="_blank">Art Conspiracy</a> festival in Bandra last year, miss very few things about Paris, except friends, family and food.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do miss French delicacies like saucissons, cheese and wine. Every time we have friends visiting, we always ask them to bring food!&#8221;</p>
