<p>As per a recent Macaron walk organised by the Pet pujaris on 28th April, Pet Pujaris gathered to find out which place in bandra served up the best macarons. They visited 7 venues , and the macarons were judged on taste, moistness and variety of flavours.</p>
<p><strong>The tops 3 winners are</strong></p>
<p>1)<strong> Marrie Anoinette</strong> &#8211; It is a cute frenchÂ patisserieÂ run by a french couple located atÂ ShirleyÂ Rajan Road.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Olives</strong> &#8211; IÂ didn&#8217;tÂ know, Olives could be a contender. Check out OlivesÂ at Union Park, Khar for some macarons. CongratulationsÂ to the chef!</p>
<p>3) <strong>Le 15</strong> &#8211; If Le 15Â didn&#8217;tÂ come up as a winner , there would have been a hysteria of a sorts considering its popularity on twitter. It is located very near to Pali market, at ambedkar road.</p>

<div>As die-hard foodies, we&#8217;re always looking out for interesting places to eat but tired of doing it alone or in the company of folks who aren&#8217;t trying to stave of the urge to lick the plate clean ðŸ˜›</div>
<div><em><em><br />
Hence, Pet Pujaris &#8211; A gang of die-hard foodies who venture out together to try new eateries in Mumbai.</em></em>We do this twice a month&#8230; once in the beginning and then towards the end. The beginning of every month will be set aside for the more pricey food establishments in Mumbai and towards the end we will dine at eateries offering more VFM. We like to call it our Fatka and Kadka Foodie Meetups :PYou can find them here on facebookÂ <a href="httpss://www.facebook.com/PetPujaris">httpss://www.facebook.com/PetPujaris</a></div>
