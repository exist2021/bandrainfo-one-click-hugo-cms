<p><b>Services offered:</b></p>
<p><b>Personal training:</b></p>
<p>BEneFIT studio operates as an exclusive studio for those serious about obtaining results. Personal training has been found to increase exercise adherence for longer and also provides the advantage of structured programmes for a given goal. One size no more fits all. And neither does one kind of physical training. Each body’s requirement, especially after a certain age is very different. Personal Training at BEneFIT offers tailor-made programmes to target individual needs.</p>
<p>Data shows 90% of the people getting results in the gym are working with a personal trainer. Working together with your very own personal trainer will get you accelerated results! Whether you are just getting started again, or want to look your best, our personal training WILL guide you to success!</p>
<p><b>Semi-personal training</b></p>
<p>Even though data shows 90% of the people getting results in the gym are working with a personal trainer, we know that not everyone can commit to personal training for financial or time restrictions. We would like to extend that graph.</p>
<p>The BeneStrength, BeneFuse, BenEndurance, BeneCore, BeneFlex, BeneBattle, BeneBalance, BeneGain are some result oriented, skillfully designed training programmes for small groups of 6 to 8 people..The determination of which programmes suit you best would depend on your goals and what you would choose of course, but only after a detailed interview with our Chief of Fitness.</p>
<p><b>Deadline Personal training</b></p>
<p><i>Want to look good for your anniversary which is in 2 months.</i></p>
<p><i> Have to look lean and hard for a photo shoot.</i></p>
<p><i> Need a push to keep you on track.</i></p>
<p><i> Having joint problems like bad knees or a bad back, the doctors advised you to lose weight, but with your condition it seems like an impossible task.</i></p>
<p>Deadline Personal Training at BEneFIT, is handled exclusively by Our chief of Fitness. Who will work with you in setting up tight but achievable deadlines and milestones, and personally assist you through the journey. And if you fully commit to the task, don’t be surprised by what you can achieve.</p>
<p>Deadlines are powerful. But don’t lose your perspective; if steroids or fat burners are the crutches you’re looking at, then BEneFIT is not the place for you. At BEneFIT, the client comes first, and we would not like to compromise your health or our ethics, for the sake of gaining a client.</p>
