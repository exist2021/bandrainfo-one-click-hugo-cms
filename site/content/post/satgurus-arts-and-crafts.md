<p>Satguru’s Art and Crafts has been one of the foremost destinations for arts and gifts serving domestic and international sectors for more than six decades. The brand is synonymous with luxury and quality and offers the best under a roof. Elegant and classy, the collection is varied with paintings, artefacts, murals, stautes, pots, wall art, religious items, tribal art.</p>
<p>The store at Linking Road which is 20000 sq ft art space is a landmark in itself  &#8211; a testament to the success of Satguru as the number one destination for arts and gifts.</p>
<p>Standing idiosyncratically apart from the heart of shopping districts as a stand alone art tower, Satguru takes you to the extraordinary ambience of art and culture.</p>
