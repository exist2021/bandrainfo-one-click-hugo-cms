<p>Today I attended a short film screening session at the Jeff Goldbery studio! What a wonderful space for creative artist to show their work at this studio. Spaces and efforts like this by the expat community who re trying to make this city livable really needs to appreciated.</p>
<p>So, yes the place is run by Mr. Jeff Goldberg who I believe is a French man from New York and who teach film making and is himself a film maker. Listen to this short clip which I recorded this afternoon at the Jeff Goldbery Studio, which is next to Moshe, or up stairs of Mamagoto at hill road.</p>
