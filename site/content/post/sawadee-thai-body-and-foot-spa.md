<p>[quote] “Sawadee” [/quote] Thai greeting referred to as the wai consists of a slight bow, with the palms pressed together in a prayer-like fashion.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/sawadee-logo.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1844 alignright" alt="sawadee logo" src="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/sawadee-logo.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/sawadee-logo.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/sawadee-logo.jpg?w=264&amp;ssl=1 264w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>It has its origin in the Indic Anjali Mudra, like the Indian namaste and the Cambodian sampeah. This word is derived from the Sanskrit svasti (meaning &#8220;well-being&#8221;).</p>
<p>[quote]The higher the hands are held in relation to the face and the lower the bow, the more respect or reverence the giver of the wai is showing.[/quote]</p>
