<p>One morning as I gave my bike for washing, I decided to walk and discover Ranwar. Every time I enter Veronica Road, a sudden peace and beauty engulf my being, the noise of traffic disappears, and here you are in a place, where development and chaos haven&#8217;t been able to get a firm foothold.</p>
<p>With the beautiful two storied old houses, one comes to understand, that how house proud these people on Veronica Road, must be, to preserve their heritage.</p>
<p><strong>Here is what this plaque tells more about Ranwar.</strong></p>

<p>The earliest historical records, with details of the birth of residence of Ranwar, preserved in the first register now in Saint Andrews Church, date to the year 1716.</p>
<p>The central passage to Ranwar, Veronica Street, was named in honour of the Holy women, Veronica, who with a soothing cloth, wiped the bloodied face of Christ, as he carried the cross on the way to Mount Calvary. For her compassion, she was rewarded with an image of Christ on the cloth. Many years ago, the Lenten procession on Palm Sunday, passed through Runwar on its way to the open ground where the &#8216;Rest Ranvar&#8217; now is, whether a reenactment of Veronica wiping the face of Jesus took place each year. Traditionally the role of Veronica was enacted by one of the young women from Ranwar village</p>
