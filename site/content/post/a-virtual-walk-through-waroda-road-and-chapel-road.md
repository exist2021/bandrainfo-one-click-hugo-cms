<p>Waroda road and Chapel road are interesting roads to walk, with hipster and Bollywood graffiti&#8217;s there is certain charm about these roads. So far there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any gentrification here and so major redevelopment of high rises have come, perhaps due to the nature of these houses, it doesn&#8217;t seem to be redevelopment friendly.</p>
