Shooting extensively across categories—travel, photojournalism, advertising, interiors, portraits, automobiles, fashion, food—he has always sought inspiration and challenge in variety. From training his lens at the blazing dome of the Taj Palace &amp; Tower when Mumbai was under siege in 2008 to documenting the placid course of the middle and lower Ganges, Ritam has framed things as disparate as spas and slums, ketchup and cars.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, Ritam has worked with corporates and publications across continents, and has also been associated with the global agency, Getty Images.</p>
<p>Apart from stills, he shoots commercial AVs, and has recently worked as a cinematographer for a feature film. Ritam has also been in the news for his theme-based calendars and his exhibitions.<br />
At Ritam Banerjee Photography we offer end-to-end visual solutions – from storyboarding, location-hunting, casting, lighting, costumes, sets, props, make-up and hair to post-production for both stills and AVs.</p>

<p>Even though digital cameras have democratised photography – making it easier for the average punter to take a shot at it – shooting a good picture can be rather difficult these days. Technology can intimidate and overwhelm – overshadowing one’s natural talent for framing and composing a beautiful image.</p>
