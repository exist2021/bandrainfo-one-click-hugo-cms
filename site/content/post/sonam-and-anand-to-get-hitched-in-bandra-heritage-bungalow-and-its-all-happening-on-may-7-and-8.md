<h6>The wedding card’s on its way. But before that, Sonam Kapoor is making calls herself these days, inviting close friends in Bollywood and out for her wedding to beau of long Anand Ahuja. It’s happening on&nbsp;<span data-term="goog_1091557564" tabindex="0"><span>May 7 and 8</span></span>. That’s official. And the entire event – yes, it’s one big glamorous&nbsp;<i>filmi</i>&nbsp;event – is being split into three different venues.</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.peepingmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sonam-anand-1.jpg?resize=630%2C420&#038;ssl=1" width="630" height="420"  data-recalc-dims="1">PeepingMoon.com was the first to tell you (on April 10) about The Leela at Sahar being a venue for the Sonam-Ahuja marriage because the five-star resort-style business hotel happens to belong to the Nair family of Sonam’s bestie Samyukta Nair. But now we can safely confirm that only the Sangeet will be held at The Leela. Not the actual Saat Pheras and Mehendi. Those are being held elsewhere, as PeepingMoon.com has learned.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.peepingmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Leela-Mumbai.jpg?resize=850%2C483&#038;ssl=1" width="850" height="483"  data-recalc-dims="1">The first big, juicy tidbit we give you is about the Mehendi. That is going to be held at Sonam’s 35-crore luxurious duplex apartment in Sunteck Signature Island building at Bandra Kurla Complex. The apartment is spread over 7,000 square feet and while it is is spacious enough for the Mehendi, the ceremony will be conducted in a Ballroom-like banquet area of the building.</p>
<p>Then there’s the Sangeet at which Bollywood’s snazziest hot steppers are going to be gladly shaking a leg for Sonam. The industry’s ace choreographer-director Farah Khan is directing this segment of the Sonam-Anand&nbsp;<i>shaadi</i>. Karan Johar will be dancing. That’s already known. Arjun Kapoor will also be dancing. And the rehearsals are being held at Sonam’s Sunteck residence. Apparently, the Sangeet at The Leela will also include the wedding reception.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.peepingmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sonam-and-anand-1-1024x1024.jpg?resize=640%2C640&#038;ssl=1" width="640" height="640"  data-recalc-dims="1">Finally, there’s the Hindu marriage ceremony itself. And here’s a big surprise. This solemn ritual will be conducted at the heritage mansion of Sonam’s aunt Kavita Singh (mother Sunita’s sister) at Bandra Bandstand near Shah Rukh Khan’s bungalow Mannat. The property is reportedly 55,000 square feet and is said to be not just one of Mumbai’s, but one of the world’s most beautiful homes with a spectacular pooja room that has Ganesha statues and&nbsp;<i>jharokas</i>&nbsp;from the South. You weren’t expecting that, right? Now the big question is – will you be there? Are you invited? Has Sonam Kapoor called you yet?</p>
