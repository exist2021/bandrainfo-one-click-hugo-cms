<blockquote><p><strong>The new cool cafe called &#8220;Cool Story&#8221; serves refreshing frozen beverages</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>On my evening walk, I discovered a beautiful cafe on 16th Road, the facade of the store and the lights inside lured me in into the cafe (also free wifi sign is a great hipster magnet). Inside the Cool Cafe was Venky who looks more a like DJ but goes by the official designation as &#8221; Wizard of Chill&#8221;. Venky introduced me to the various frozen beverages; he began with &#8220;Frocktails&#8221; a word coined by joining the two words &#8220;frozen&#8221; and &#8220;cocktails.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he introduced me to Fratte, which is a milk based frozen latte. I went for plain vanilla but you can try the fancier flavors like butterscotch, caramel-kissed coffee, mango and if you prefer ethnic go for the paan-e-Shaan which I am sure will make an excellent after dinner plan. Also, you could try the Fratte overload which is the fratte+gelato on the top.</p>

The story behind the &#8220;Cool Story.&#8221;</b></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-9043 alignright" src="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2.jpg?resize=375%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="2" width="375" height="500" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2.jpg?resize=375%2C500&amp;ssl=1 375w, https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Venky tells me he and the founder Saurabh Malhotra, who goes by the official designation of &#8220;Cheif Mixologist,&#8221; are very popular with their brand of frozen beverages in the pop-up store circuit, having served to thousands of patrons in &#8220;Celebrate Bandra,&#8221; Bandra flea market and Kitch mandi events around Bandra.</p>
<p>The cool story guys have invested in the state of art machines for making slush and have an in-house gelato machines and make the own gelatos. They import a lot of ingredients straight from Italy to maintain the authenticity of the taste.</p>
<p>Venky and Saurabh both come from events background, both have worked together for the Bandra-based &#8220;Fountainhead Entertainment&#8221; so one can expect the cafe to be an experience rather than a place of consumption. They have a vertical bookshelf filled with some amazing classics for ex. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson&#8217;s, Eoin Colfer, &#8220;and another thing&#8221;. I just plan to come back to read one chapter of each of these books; such is the impressive collection.</p>

<p>They also have your favorite board games available, if you are at all into board games, which the writer has no prior knowledge off.</p>
