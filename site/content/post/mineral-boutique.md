<p>MINERAL is postmodern women’s clothing. It’s a smart design recombination of predominantly natural Indian fabrics within a Western construct, creating clothing that makes a woman look and feel special.</p>
<p>The clothes do not sport flashy logos or insignia and hopefully will be worn and recognized for being simply great clothes, that you want to live within, every day of your life. And hence our line “no more seasons”.</p>
