<p>Greener spaces are an integral part of urban life that define the layout of the community. As we have started living in increasingly built up environments, the need for parks is as important in the 21<sup>st</sup> century as it was in the 19<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>They are the community’s natural life support systems and a well maintained park in an area can increase the real estate value manifold.</p>

<p>Here’s five of our favorite places to sit back and relax: the green gems tucked away in the corners of Bandra.</p>
