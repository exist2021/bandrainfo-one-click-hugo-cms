<p>Loose ends, the store – is not born out of an idea.</p>
<p>Founded in 2004, it is born, like all good things, out of conflict. It reflected the founder Madhumita Goswami’s love for all things unusual.</p>
<p>To put it simply, Loose Ends, located in Bandra, Mumbai, is a uniquely different lifestyle store that carries home accessories and clothes.</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/05/loose-ends2.jpg"> </a></p>
<p>The in-house label is definitely what gives Loose Ends an edge over other stores.</p>
<p>If you are tired of frequently the same old state emporia for buying stuff, look no further than Loose ends.</p>
<p>This eclectic space is filled with interesting stuff, from coasters to lamps, cushions, t-shirts, ashtrays, vases, fashionable embellished mirrors, photo frames, wall art, pillow cases, shelves to boxes and hooks.</p>
