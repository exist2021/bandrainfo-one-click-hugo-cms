<p>Growing up in the 70&#8217;s and 80&#8243;s, i knew of two 5 star hotels in bandra. One was Searock and the much infamous Caesars palace hotel. When I was a kid, I had attended a wedding at Hotel Searock poolside, It was a catholic wedding and i was scandalised by a huge roasted pig in the center of the table and the big blue swimming pool. That is my most vivid memory of Hotel Searock. I was wondering what it means to bandraites.</p>

<p><strong>What does the main stream media say about Searock Hotel (Some snippets &amp; links) </strong></p>

More than a building with rooms, it was the playground of Bollywood, suburban businessmen and lotharios. It also boasted a revolving restaurant, The Palace of the West Empress. And then it had that location. Right at the tip of Bandra, on the waterfront.</p>
<h3>&#8220;I believe half of Bandra was conceived in or around Sea Rock,&#8221; says Umesh, son of Girdharilal Luthria, one of the four brothers who built Sea Rock in 1978. The other three were Udharam, Shyam and Manohar.</h3>

<p><strong>Some snippets from blogosphere. </strong></p>
<p>The SeaRock was Bombay’s first serious attempt to shift away from the Fort and Nariman Point to the suburbs, and viewed as a Johnnie-come-lately by stalwarts Taj and Oberoi, from whom it grabbed both eyeballs and business when it opened in 1978. The arrangement with Welcomgroup, as the ITC chain, then newly launched, was known initially, was for marketing and management, before the 400-room property was leased to the group.

<p>In the early eighties, it introduced Bombay to several firsts, including a frontier restaurant called “The Earthen Oven”, the rooftop revolving restaurant “The Palace of the West Empress”, known for its Chinese cuisine, the popular coffee shop “The Oceanic” and a vegetarian restaurant “Vega”. Its Playmate Club was a gathering place with a somewhat less salubrious reputation, but it was where the film fraternity and its financers — in those days the underworld — probably met. Several Welcomgroup hoteliers — Dammi Sabherwal, Channi Pantal, Anil Channa — cut their teeth managing the SeaRock.Read more <a href="https://blog.kiranghag.com/2010/09/hotel-searock-gone-forever.html">https://blog.kiranghag.com/2010/09/hotel-searock-gone-forever.html</a></p>
