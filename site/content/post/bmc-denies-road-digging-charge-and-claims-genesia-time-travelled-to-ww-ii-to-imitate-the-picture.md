<p dir="ltr">Genesia Alves has made <a href="https://bzfd.it/2q3ZCmb" target="_blank">history</a> by cloning the WW II picture to feature the powerlessness of an Bandraite.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The rationale for the pits in Bandra is an enigma, so I used my connections in BMC to gain information.</p>
<p>Following are the responses and I call upon the readers to draw on their good sense to scoop out the fact.</p>
<h3>The Responses</h3>
<p dir="ltr">1) A representative in return for confidentiality says &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;NASA is considering awarding&nbsp;BMC a 500 Billion USD contract. BMC would build the infrastructure on Mars for the inhabitation of the super rich. Bandra is where we are practising for our space venture.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>2) Another spiritually inclined official from HW ward claimed Bandra people have become cynical and thus they see only dug up streets. It is their Karma that they don&#8217;t look at the good motorable roads.</p>
<p>3) An officer and  a huge a sci-fi afficionado said he is not aware of  any digging. On being shown a copy of <a href="https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/bandra-woman-trolls-bmc-as-it-leaves-a-pile-of-rubble-near-her-house/articleshow/58371635.cms?utm_source=mumbaimirror&amp;utm_medium=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=referral" target="_blank">Mumbai Mirror</a>, he said it&#8217;s plausible that the lady in the coloured print has time travelled to the WW II.</p>
