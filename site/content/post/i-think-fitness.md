<p>Located in a plush by-lane of Bandra west, I Think fitness is a revolutionary new fitness center taking fitness to another level.</p>
<p>I Think Fitness is the brain child of fitness enthusiast Suren Joshi, and Mishali Sanghani, the co-owners of the popular eatery, Pali Village Café.</p>
<p>Not only does the gym at I Think Fitness contain brand new state-of-the-art gym equipment manufactured in the United States, this fitness center also houses a sleek spinning studio in an elevated loft overlooking the humongous gym floor. The spinning studio houses high-end bicycles that are as close to real bicycles as possible. The gym floor, situated on the top floor of its building provides a calming view of the leafy by-lanes of Bandra. Not only that, but the floor to ceiling windows to the front of the gym floor allow for ample sunlight during the day, showering the gym in comforting hues of natural light.</p>
