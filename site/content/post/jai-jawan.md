<p>How’s the idea of eating the tastiest food at the hands of some of the fastest chefs at the local joint in one of the busiest places in the city?</p>
<p>At the junction of 14th Road &amp; PD Hinduja Marg, adjascent to Linking Road,you can find the Jai Jawan bustling with activity. With the National College nearby, placing an order could be very difficult but the food served here makes the wait worth it.</p>
<p>Tandoori chicken and Chicken tikka, two of the most illustrious creations from the tandoor are specialties here.  The menu at Jai Jawan is replete with non -vegetarian delicacies including the prawns marinated to perfection with aromatic masalas which make for an extraordinary meal.</p>
<p>The restaurant is open 6.30 pm onwards and the food items are reasonably priced.</p>
<p>Be it fried fish with pav and chutney or the mouth watering seekh kababs, Jai Jawan is a sure stop for visitors to Bandra from the remotest areas of Mumbai.</p>
<p>Take an excuse to go shoe shopping in Bandra and drop in at Jai Jawan. You just cannot miss it!</p>
