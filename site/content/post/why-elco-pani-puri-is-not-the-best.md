The Best Pani Puri In Bandra, No it is not Elco! Read my full [take here](__GHOST_URL__/the-best-pani-puri-in-bandra-no-it-is-not-elco/).

# What are the alternatives then?

## Karachi Sweets

My vote goes to Karachi sweets which is a bit further down the road and doesn't have the same parking facility which might discourage many people who come to Bandra in cars.

## Punjab Sweet House Pali Naka

Of course, Pali Naka is another beast when it comes to traffic. But eating Pani Puri at Punjab Sweet House means you have achieved masters in discovering Bandra.

## [Maharashtra Chana Bandar Pali Naka](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&client=safari&rls=en&biw=1440&bih=709&sxsrf=ALeKk03o6wcpKXJo5napBiGAjZ2g6fUkNw%3A1601371100496&ei=3PtyX__3Heyd4-EP0dOBkAU&q=maharashtra+chana+bandar+pali+naka&oq=maharashtra+chana+bandar+pali+naka&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECAAQR1CDEFicGWDCG2gAcAJ4AIAB5wGIAbUJkgEFMC4zLjOYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEIwAEB&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwj_1eSchI7sAhXszjgGHdFpAFIQ4dUDCAw&uact=5)

This place is probably ovr hyped for it's sevpuri and vadapav. But it has got it's diehard loyalists.

## GuruKripa Samosa

The newly opened placed is already getting lot of traction as it is on the prime 16th Road next to Khane Khas and its brand reputation is quite solid.
