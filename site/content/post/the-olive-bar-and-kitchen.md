<p>The Olive Bar and Kitchen is a rustic hideaway where good food, laughter, culture and conversation come together in a delightful Mediterranean melting pot.</p>
<p>A place where beautiful people meet to celebrate life&#8217;s simple journey, the Olive Bar &amp; Kitchen in Mumbai is something of a landmark- a place where the city’s happy people congregate to dine well, to dip into an outstanding cellar, and to linger over laughter and conversation.</p>

<p>The menu draws inspiration from across the Mediterranean, juggling ingredients and cooking styles expertly to produce a menu that’s as surprising as it is delicious, and best defined as progressive Mediterranean world cuisine.</p>
<p>The cellar boasts a wide range of classic and contemporary wines from across the world.</p>

<p>Just like the city, Mumbai’s Olive is a bit of a chameleon. Olive Bandra turns up the volume to fever pitch on Thursdays at its signature bar nights &#8211; TGIT (Thank God It’s Thursday) &#8211; with the city’s party people flitting in and around. The place explodes with music and high spirits.The first Thursday of every month witnesses Olive turning into The Fashion District. Lazy Saturdays offer a deliciously decadent brunch through the afternoon. Sundays witness a distinctive shift in mood with the celebrated Sunday Brunch, that ode to superb food, fine spirits and good cheer.</p>
