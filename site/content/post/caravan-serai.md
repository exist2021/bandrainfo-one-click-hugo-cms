The dining space is an interesting amalgam &#8211; it is elegant and at the same time reflects the rustic charm of the bygone days when traders and pilgrims gathered and discussed everything from politics and poetry over hot meals.</p>
<p>Tables with a snug low-seating, delicate mirror curtains, dimly-lit lamps, tasteful handicrafts define the decor and faint tunes of punjabi and folk music set the mood for a lavish time. Enclosed in a jute casing are recipes your tastebuds will relish &#8211; there’s Raan-e-Pukhtan, Batte Ka Murgh, Lasooni Jinga, varieties of spicy Kebabs &amp; Tikkas, and many more treasured creations your taste buds will tingle with.</p>
