<p dir="auto"><span>The Honourable Secretary and select members of the Society of Balmoral Hall, Mount Mary Road, Bandra West 400050 have installed an Airtel Mobile tower on the roof of Balmoral Hall despite the majority of residents in the building opposing and voting against the installation. I hope the concerned departments will direct us to a resolution.</span></p>
