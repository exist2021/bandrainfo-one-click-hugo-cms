<p>Everything over in a fraction of second when a speeding auto rickshaw hit a 45-year-old pedestrian on 16th road in Bandra (West) on November 23. The closed-circuit television (CCTV) captured the spine-chilling accident in which the victim identified as Sangeeta Hausarmal got flung in air before landing on her head that cost her her life. Khar police arrested the reckless driver Manojkumar Yadav (20) from the spot and found that he was driving without a valid driving licence.</p>
<p>Yadav was produced before the Bandra Court on November 24. He has been sent to judicial custody after no one turned up to stand surety and pay the bail sum for his release. Meanwhile the police are waiting for the owner of the rickshaw that Yadav was driving. “Action will be initiated against the owner for giving the vehicle keys to Yadav who does not have a valid driving licence,” said a police officer. Khar police senior inspector Sanjay More told Bandra Info news that owner of the rickshaw driver is out of station.  </p>

<p>The incident occurred at around 1pm when Hausarmal, employed as inhouse domestic help, has gone to a shop in the neighbourhood to buy household materials for her employer. Police said the vehicle knocked down Hausarmal while she was crossing the road to go to her employer’s house in the neighbourhood. Yadav was arrested from the spot. Hausarmal died on the spot after he was thrown in air and landed on her head causing severe head injuries.</p>
<p>The eight-second accident CCTV grab has gone viral on the social media. Meanwhile the police are awaiting for the rickshaw owner return to Mumbai for allowing Yadav to drive despite knowing he does not have a valid licence. “The victim was employed as a domestic help. She was returning to her employer’s home after buying household materials from a neighbourhood shop. The accused driver was heading towards SV Road when all of a sudden he hit the woman. The driver does not hold a licence,” said Khar police senior inspector More.</p>
<p>Locals and people present in the shop who witnessed the incident said everything happened in a fraction of a second. “The speeding rickshaw after hitting the victim crashed into a parked vehicle. The driver did not suffer any injury. The woman was crossing the road after a taxi passed. She did not notice the speeding rickshaw that came all of a sudden and hit her. She died on the spot with severe blood loss,” a local, Manish Kale told TOI.</p>
<p>Yadav did not flee from the spot and the locals called the police and handed him to them. He has been booked under the Indian Penal Code sections 279 (rash driving), 304 (A) (causing death due to negligence) and the Motor Vehicle Act sections 181 (owner or person in-charge of a vehicle permitting an unlicensed person or an under-aged person to drive it) and 184 (driving dangerously).</p>
<p>Hausarmal’s family members who resides in the neighbourhood were in a state of shock and turned down to talk. A family member said that they want justice and severe action against the reckless driver.</p>
<p>Meanwhile locals said speeding rickshaw has become a menace on the small lane (16th road) in Bandra (west). Many times they scratch pass parked cars and does not care for pedestrians.</p>
