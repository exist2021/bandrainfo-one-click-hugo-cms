<p>The Hyderabadi Pakwaan is a preciously preserved culinary art like no other.</p>
<p>A-400 year history behind the culinary delights was evolved in the kitchens of the Nizams of Golconda who elevated Ghizaayat (food) to a sublime art form. Hyderabadi cuisine reflects a perfect amalgamation of influence from the Arabic, Turkish, Kayasth, Marathawada and the natives of the Deccan plateau.</p>
