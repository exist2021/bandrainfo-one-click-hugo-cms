<p>The word Sukho is derived from the Sanskrit word “Sukh” which stands for happiness and Thai is taken from Thailand. Sukho Thai is considered to be the first true Thai kingdom. Founded by Khun Pha Muang and Khun Bang Klang Thao in 1238, the Kingdom was named by its rulers &#8220;the dawn of happiness&#8221;-Sukho Thai. The Sukhothai period is often considered the golden era of Thai history.</p>
