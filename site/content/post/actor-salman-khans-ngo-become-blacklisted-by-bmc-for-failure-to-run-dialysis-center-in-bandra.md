<p>Bollywood celebrity Salman Khan’s Being Human Foundation, a charity outfit that actually works for the underprivileged within the education and health sectors, is likely to be blacklisted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for maybe not running a dialysis center in Bandra.</p>
<p>After providing two show-cause notices into NGO final thirty days, the BMC’s health department is currently in the process of blacklisting it.</p>
<p>Whenever contacted, the official with the Foundation, who did not desire to be identified, said: “We don&#8217;t wish to state something.”</p>
<p>Dr Padmaja Keskar, BMC’s executive wellness officer, verified that Foundation has been blacklisted because has been doing absolutely nothing to start businesses during the center, that has been lying shut and unused as it ended up being create and paid towards the NGO in 2016. The centre is supposed to offer the health center to residents at least expense.</p>
<p>In July 2016, after a tendering procedure, the NGO ended up being allocated a 250 square metre area at Bandra’s St John Road to operate 24 dialysis devices in a public-private relationship foundation. “The project had been never ever been implemented. After we delivered them a reminder last December, the foundation responded saying it cannot run the dialysis center owing to some difficulty,” said Keskar. “We will now issue a notice to blacklist the Foundation.”</p>
<p>The BMC delivered two letters to your Bollywood actor’s NGO, on January 6 and January 18, to caution the organization so it could be blacklisted for “showing neglect” after bidding when it comes to task.</p>
<p>As there has been no good reaction, the BMC is currently refloating tenders when it comes to dialysis center. When the Foundation is blacklisted, it cannot bid for similar task once again.</p>
