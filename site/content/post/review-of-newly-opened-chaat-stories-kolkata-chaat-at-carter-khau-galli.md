<p dir="auto">This bright red communist coloured store at carters khau galli has nothing communist except the colour. All the chaats priced there can make capitalist salivate. </p>
<p>Carters khau galli has a high turnover and there are plenty of new eateries replacing the older ones. I take a walk here once a month, and can see atleast 2/3 new outlets during my monthly jaunts. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Being a Jhal Mudi (Kolkatta Bhel) fan, I had to go and check out this store. What&#8217;s nice is the store is neatly laid out. The Puchka guy is right outside where he should be and the hot off the pan, mung-dal chilla counter is at the entrance on the left and the Kulhar chai guy on the right. Inside the store is the cashier and the chaat guy.</p>

<p>The shape of shingada (samosa&#8217;s) and the jalebi will give you wet dreams. This is what bandra needed badly, a authentic taste of Kolkatta in Bandra and finally they have got it. </p>
<p>Except the strategically expensive priced menu I had nothing to complain, service was top class so was my jhal mudi. (Rs 70 ).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Highly recommend you check out this place and let us know, what other things are awesome here. I am keen to try the mung dal chilla (Rs 100/- and puchkas Rs 90/- next time around.</p>
