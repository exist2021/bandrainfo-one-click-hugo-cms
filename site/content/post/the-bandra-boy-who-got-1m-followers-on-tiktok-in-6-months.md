_Furkan Aibani is a Tiktok sensation in 5 months with over 1M followers. I know him because you used a run a cute little shop called "Kanafeh" selling delicious creamy middle eastern delicacy called Kunafa. If I was on a walk to Shirley I would sneak in and order an apple tea along with the Kunafa. It was an amazing experience and I saw that he would passionately prepare and serve. I lost touch with him and rediscovered that the shop got shut during lockdown but now he has become a Tiktok star._

_Read his interview below._

## Can you introduce yourself and your various social media channels to our readers?

Hi, my name is Furkan Aibani and I am known by **SavageNewFurkan** for my horror and conspiracy stories and sometimes a fun news segment called as savage news. My [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/SavageNewsFurkan) and [tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@savagenewsfurkan) name is savagenewsfurkan and my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/furkanaibani/?hl=en) and [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/add/furkanaibani) is furkanaibani.

## Please share your TikTok influencer journey to 1M followers.

My journey to 1M was crazy fast, I started working on tiktok videos from **April ending and I had 20 followers**. I posted my first video on **explaining the parallel universe in Hindi and it got around 1M views** and I was having 6-7k followers.

### Shadow Banned

I was quite happy but the editing to that videos was a long process still I was going on and making videos daily where all of my videos were getting around 500k to 800k views and I was at 25k followers in a week and then I was shadowbanned as I deleted all my videos of the past musically. I was banned for a week and then again after a week I started posting and this time it was crazy.

### A Fresh Start

**The first video I posted reached 3M views** after the ban and **I went from 25k followers to 200k followers in a day and after that just 15 days later I was on 1.1M followers with 30M views on one video and rest all above 1M views**.

### After Tiktok Ban

Then the ban started in India of tiktok and I hope it gets back soon. I am doing good on YouTube, Snapchat & Instagram but the Tiktok had some different spark to it.

## How is it living in Bandra? How long have you lived there?

I have grown up in Bandra from school to college and then work everything is done in Bandra.

> From Ravi Rice to Taj land ends food, Bandra is the most chill and amazing place in Mumbai according to me.

## What was the idea behind Kanafeh and are you planning to open again?

The idea behind kanafeh was the Kanafeh dessert itself. People in India knew about it but never had it because there was no kanafeh (kunafa) shop around at that time and we had plans to make the premium kanafeh dessert in reasonable price so that everyone can afford and have it whenever they want.

### A Low Price version without compromise in Taste

The dessert kanafeh is very premium accord to India as the material of the dessert is not available here. If you go to the high-end restaurants they serve kanafeh but the prices are too high and we wanted to make not only kanafeh price low but also all the Turkish food and dessert as low as possible so everyone can have a taste of turkey.

## Middle East Travel

I had kanafeh from all over the world (Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi & More) but the only modification we did in our kanafeh was made it little more like a dessert then something savoury as in Jordan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡´ people prefer the dessert a bit salty as in savoury. **Due to lockdown, we closed it down but I have the vision to see kanafeh back again in 2021 with a bigger and better place.**

## What are some favourite places to shop/eat/hang out in Bandra?

Bandra is amazing, **to shop at hill road and the link square is the best** just beware of the crowd.

> For eating is the **Pali Hill Punjab sweets Samosa, wow itâ€™s just wow**.

And for hangout, the Carter Road Khao Galli which is the best as the rents are soo high there that no one stays longer than 3 months so we get to eat more different verities there with a hangout session.

## Tell us some secrets about Bandra?

If you donâ€™t have enough money for food go at the Bandra bazaar and have food at the **National Bakery** or in the line.

> You get **30Rs ka garlic sandwich which will fill your stomach** and itâ€™s just for 30rs what do you even expect more and yes travel by scooter only in Bandra.
