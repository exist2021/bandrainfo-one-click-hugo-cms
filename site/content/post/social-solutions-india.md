<p>Corporate heavyweights comprise the larger institutional investors in social responsibility by mandate but there is a need for the individual investors &#8211; a larger and potentially untapped resource &#8211; to bridge the gap that will make social responsibility integral to the common man.</p>
<p>Social Solutions is the means for every individual to invest in society and make a difference without being made to feel guilty, humbled and apologetic.<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ssi-logo.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1128 alignright" alt="ssi logo" src="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ssi-logo.jpg?resize=340%2C199&#038;ssl=1" width="340" height="199" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ssi-logo.jpg?w=340&amp;ssl=1 340w, https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ssi-logo.jpg?resize=300%2C175&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Associated with Munes Khanna, MD &amp; CEO- Centrum Capital, Dr. Bharati Chawathe -Spring Psychotherapy Centre, Social Solutions India  is managed by Shirin Juwaley and Batull Tavawala, both professionals with over 20 yrs experience in the development sector.</p>
<p>Social Solutions’ business model has been designed to cater to the neglected communication/funding needs of the NGOs, using existing tools to gain maximum leverage and develop an approach which can be easily integrated with the extensive globalization and its impact on social values and economic trends.

<p>Social Solutions continuously strives to actualize and simplify every individual’s desire of giving with an aim to gratify every individual’s yearning to serve mankind.</p>
