<p>Pronto is a chain of quick service restaurants that offers something for each member of the family.</p>
<p>‘Pronto’, the Italian word for ‘ready’ is commonly used when answering the phone, indicating the listener is “ready” to start the conversation.</p>
<p>“Pronto means we are ready to start serving you.”</p>
<p>Pronto prides in the quality of food they serve – the ingredients used and the care taken in preparing the dishes.</p>
