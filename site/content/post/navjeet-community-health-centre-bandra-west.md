<p>Utkarsh – rural outreach:</p>
<p>In 2006, Navjeet began its rural outreach with the Katkaris in Shahapur.Taluka,Thane Dist. Navjeet&#8217;s plan is to uplift the lives of the Katkaris through Education, Health Care and Community Development programs, and to improve their economic status through Agriculture, Water harvesting, Livestock farming. Income generation projects have been initiated through Self Help Groups in areas of goat and buffalo rearing, stationery shop, canteen, and tailoring units.</p>
<p>Nav E-bureau:</p>
<p>Since Navjeet is attached to the Holy Family Hospital, there is a constant need for ward attendants for the patients. Accordingly, in 2002, Navjeet formed the Nav-e-Bureau to train ward attendants in patient care. Navjeet ensures a background check on every attendant and provides them specialised training in patient care. The bureau now maintains a register and ID cards are given to them. In this project, women and men are can earn a modest living.</p>
