Dubbed “Clue Hunt”, it is India’s First Live Escape Game. &#8220;Escape Room&#8221; games is a pretty recent gaming phenomenon worldwide wherein a group of people (gamers) are physically locked inside a themed room and their goal is to find clues hidden around them to get out of the room within 60 minutes of time.</p>
<p>These games are hugely popular in cities like San Francisco, Dublin, Tokyo, Bangkok, London, Budapest and are soon catching on in newer markets like Dubai, Cape Town, Paris and Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>The games are unlike anything currently out there in India &#8211; they will be apt for tourists/travellers as an activity during their stay, collegians looking for an alternative means of entertainment, corporates looking to indulge their team in some fun and team-building exercise, as well as for families looking to have a good time out.</p>
<p>“Couple things that prompted us to start Clue Hunt in India is the uniqueness of the concept and the advent of ‘Experiential Gaming’ worldwide. People do not want to sit in one place and play on their PCs or mobiles. Today they want to indulge in interactive, fun games that can be stimulating and social at the same time. As such, we are very optimistic about the future of the game and have partnered with KyaZoonga to do online scheduling and ticketing for us.”, says Ketan Chhatpar (co-founder). “Presently, we have conducted trial runs and have launched our first game ‘Mr. Spylock&#8217;s Chamber’ on 1<sup>st</sup> December, and will be launching our second game ‘Kaboom!’ on 15<sup>th</sup> December. Two games with two different themes, but same difficulty level. Each of these can be played in a group of two to five people.”, adds Tina Chhatpar (co-founder).</p>
<p>The arrival of Clue Hunt in Mumbai adds much-needed variety to the entertainment options available in Mumbai, which, is a truly international city today.</p>
