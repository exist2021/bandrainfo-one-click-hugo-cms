<p>The glittering success story of Nayaab, the most renowned jewelers of Jaipur, can trace its origins to a family history that goes back almost a century. It all started with Shri Ugarsinghji Bothra, lovingly called &#8216;Bausaa&#8217;, who entered the gems and jewelry trade at the tender age of 9, with a very humble beginning and a dream in his heart.</p>
<p>Before long, because of his skills, dedication and hard work, Bausaa became a partner of the renowned Haveli Group, one of the very few and oldest institutes imparting training and expertise to jewellers in Rajasthan.</p>
<p>Today, at the helm of affairs and the owner of Nayaab, is Upendrasingh Bothra.</p>
<p>With our innovative light weight and detachable jadau jewelry and classical ethnical designs from the regal collections, we pay tribute to the New Woman of India, emerging as the inspiring power of the nation, we set the milestone in the jewelry legacy of the changing India.</p>
<p>To defend the motto &#8216;Once created, never replicated&#8217; and represent the exclusivity in every design as well as the very personal approach to each customer, the brand introduces many design innovations in diamond, gold and jadau section.</p>
<p>Every piece of Nayaab is created by a team of six designers headed by Manali Bothra, the main inspiration and designer par excellence. With her inspired vision of the modern diva she has managed to bring alive an exotic beauty in her designs and even to involve customers into the process of creation. Nayaab offers the unique feature to its crme clientele to customize a design according to its taste and demand, highlighting the value of the personality of each customer.</p>

<p>Nayaab&#8217;s jadau jewelry is crafted to compliment both Indian and Western outfits, to outshine every season and occasion. Apart from classical jadau designs, Nayaab introduced the unique feature: pieces embedded and attached in a jadau design is detachable. Mr. Bothra explains the reason behind this innovation, &#8220;Usually heavy jewelry is preserved for special occasion, and thus tends to gather dust in a locker till their need arises. But, at Nayaab we give our customer the choice of detaching each piece from the original design, and use it in lighter designs meant for more frequent use&#8221;. Another innovation from Nayaab is a concept to carve a jadau set which puts very little weight on your body. Nayaab breaks the monotony and adds exclusivity to the art of jadau with its contemporary jadau designs.</p>
<p><b>Diamond Jewelry</b></p>
<p>Apart from Jadau, Nayaab houses an exquisite collection of Diamond and colour stone jewelry. The diamond designs from Nayaab are available in a very wide variety, ranging from the exotic necklaces, which have graced many grand weddings such as the Arun Nair-Liz Hurly wedding, where Nair&#8217;s mother wore Nayaab designs. To small trinkets, such as rings and cufflinks that many Nayaab admirers wear every day as a statement of beauty and grace. The store has a variety of diamond pieces for everybody and every occasion.</p>
<p><b>Gold Jewelry</b></p>
<p>According to a Marathi custom children are told to spend a portion of their pocket money on buying gold. This inculcates in them a habit of saving a port of their income for future. At Nayaab, this tradition is well understood, and a sincere endeavor is made to ensure that both the quality and variety of designs are such that they serve the purpose as an ornament as well as an investment.</p>
