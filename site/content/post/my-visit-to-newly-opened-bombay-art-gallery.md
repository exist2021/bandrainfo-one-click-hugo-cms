<hr />
<p>I have been waiting for the opening of Bombay Art Society at Reclamation for a long time; so when our honorable <a href="https://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-02-13/news/70592917_1_art-gallery-prime-minister-narendra-modi-art-works">Prime Minister inaugurated</a> the Bombay Art Society it only increased my expectations about the place. The building which many find ugly is imposing. I think the building is quite beautiful though it seems to be a POV of a Sobo-ite on how architecture in Bandra should be.</p>
<p>Check the article in <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/the-iconic-bombay-art-society-unveils-an-arts-complex-in-bandra/story-TvgXm0YF6Ae94n5sw50QlM.html">Hindustan Times</a> on the current art on display.</p>

School of Arts building, maybe the lady is on a temporary visit and just exhibiting here. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8881" src="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/soveniors.jpg?resize=375%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="soveniors" width="375" height="500" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/soveniors.jpg?resize=375%2C500&amp;ssl=1 375w, https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/soveniors.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/soveniors.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" data-recalc-dims="1" />On the ground floor, there is the first gallery, and there is small curio shop selling you souvenirs like T-shirts and mugs. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit;">On the first floor, we have two galleries and the reference library and on the 2nd floor, there is a small canteen, which is looking for some contractor to run the same and an auditorium which can seat about 75 people I guess. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit;">The Bombay Art Gallery Building at Reclamation seems to be a labour of love and tremendous effort is being taken to run it and curate the best in Art there. Drishti construction had developed the building and as part of an agreement, the backside of the building is owned by the developer. In future, some high-end restaurants might come up there.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit;">Finally, I am so happy that I can satiate my desire for Art in Bandra itself and spend a couple of quiet hours browsing the galleries and don&#8217;t have to travel to Kalaghoda or restrict myself to some hipster art. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit;">If you have visited the new Bombay Art Gallery, do let me know about your views in the comments below. </span></p>
