<p>[quote]Yoga is a <strong>“Mirror of Truth”</strong> that reflects our true nature. And to look into it, is the first step to discover ourselves[/quote] says Arun Kumar  who is an instructor at The Yoga House, Bandra, Mumbai.</p>
<p>Housing a yoga studio, a shop and a health food cafe, the concept of The Yoga House has been designed to share a system of living based on authenticity and awareness.</p>
<p>Qualified instructors in yoga including Achal Mehra, Alexandra Copley, Ajit Singh Tapaswi and others focus on various yoga styles like  ashtanga vinyasa, ayur-yoga, hatha yoga, iyengar yoga, pranayama, sathyananda yoga, sivananda yoga, vinyasa flow and yoga nidra. The Yogic Arts Instructors with decades of enriching experience have a background which is grounded in disciplines of Yoga, Ballet, Gymnastics, Martial Arts, Modern Dance, Thai Massage, Meditation, and Empowering Emotional and Spiritual Growth Techniques.</p>

<p>The focus is on body intelligence techniques to experience meditation through them and help handle stress in day to day living. They ensure that every yoga class should spark the kindle of self-discovery and body-wellness in the students by instilling the <strong>“Being here now”</strong> philosophy.</p>
<p>[quote]For me my practice is about worshipping the divine within and this is what I offer to my students as well — the ability to switch off and discover who they really are. I was taught that this process requires a quiet mind hence my class focuses on bringing stillness in the body and mind through asana, pranayama and relaxation. Says Aditi M Gaur who teaches a traditional Hatha Yoga practice.[/quote]</p>
<p>Mitha Hede, a certified kids yoga instructor from The Yoga Institute, Santacruz feels that this unique health practice helps in developing a strong foundation in their early years that can help them gain confidence, have clarity of thought, be responsible and be able to cope with stress. It incorporates music, games, stories and activities to make asanas interesting and fun. She hopes to make the first experience of yoga a pleasant one as children build themselves physically as well as emotionally.</p>
<p>The Yoga House also offers prenatal yoga classes every week.</p>

<p>The Yoga House food concept is a subtle combination of cutting-edge macrobiotic recipes and ancient dietary wisdom and traditions.Their delicious, highly energizing meals nourish the body and mind while complementing and enhancing the effects of Yoga. The menu centers around whole cereal grains, seeds and nuts, and local, seasonal fruits and vegetables. Because they serve much of the fruits and vegetables raw, they are actually living foods with active living enzymes. This means they are easier to digest and full of essential vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>The food is prepared with great care, attention to details and positive outcome.</p>

<p>From the ancient and royal culture of north India, come the Khansa pots in which the meals are served.<strong> &#8216;Khansa&#8217;</strong> is a handmade vessel, in a studied mixture of copper and tin &#8211; the specific combination in this metal provides needed minerals to the body. Eating from vessels of this metal also has these added benefits: Khansa strengthens the liver, purifies the blood, promotes the white blood cell count (WBC) and therefore, wholly, increases the body&#8217;s immunity against ill-health and disease.</p>
<p>At The Yoga House, along with enjoying the sensual delights of the recipes come the benefits of their profound healing and nourishing effects.</p>
<p>The aim is to provide guests with a better understanding and respect of the body and mind, to help them to participate more actively and joyfully in their daily life.</p>
<p>Yoga is considered to be the most valuable Indian inheritance of the present and believe it is an essential need of today. At Yoga House it is believed that Yoga is much more than asanas- it is a way of life.</p>
