<p>Hop n Bop are suburb’s newest monstrous little geeks and they are here to introduce the city to the first suburban soft play area and activity centre, complete with ball pools, slides, trampolines, wall toys, soft bridges and for the first time in the city – a water bed! Hop n Bop is where you can bring your kids when they are full of beans, peppy, animated and bouncy with excitement – it is a dreamworld for kids and their excess energy! Hop n Bop is a new 2,000 sq ft soft play area and activity centre located in the heart of the city, on bustling Linking Road, Bandra. It comprises two play zones – Little Monsters (for kids 6 months to 3 years of age) and Big Monsters (for kids above 3 years and up to 8 years). The sprawling premises of Hop n Bop also include a “Tell Me More” reception area, “I Need a Wee” washroom, a “Supplies!” pantry, a “No Homework” classroom and Hop n Bop’s “I Am Hungry” café that will dish out scrumptious, healthy bites for those serious after-play hunger pangs.</p>
<p><b>WHAT IS SOFT PLAY?</b></p>
<p>Hop n Bop are here to give a new meaning to “staying indoors”; they want you to come indoors and play, learn, think, grow. Hop n Bop is a new soft play area – a safe, soft environment to allow kids to actively play and develop new motor skills such as learning to climb, balance, build blocks, and hone social skills by playing with other kids. This constructive downtime is equipped with a variety of games and playing facilities for various age groups – from 6 months to 8 years – that stimulate and encourage children to think and make the most of this exploratory playtime. This soft play area is ideal for kids of our city, which sees a dearth of parks and other public spaces where typically kids can let loose.</p>
<p><b>Why opt for a soft play area?</b></p>
<p>Active play boosts physical, mental, emotional and social skills</p>
<p>Your child learns to be social while playing and interacting with other children</p>
<p>Helps hone your child’s creative and imagination abilities</p>
<p>This kind of play helps boost fitness levels using fun techniques</p>
<p>Great for any weather conditions</p>
