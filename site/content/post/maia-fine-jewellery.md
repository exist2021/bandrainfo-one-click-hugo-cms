<p>Weaver of magic… veil of illusion… earth goddess… virgin mother… giver of life… eternal and forever… Maia symbolises many things to many cultures.</p>
<p>For centuries, the word Maia has resonated with dreams of romance, power and love and has continued to weave an irresistible magic. It has symbolised the dreams and desires we all hold within ourselves&#8230; to be loved and adored by everyone and to dazzle them with our individual brilliance.</p>
<p>This is precisely what Maia Fine Jewellery represents. It symbolises the fire that burns within each of us. A desire to own the most prized possession&#8230; the fire and brilliance of the clearest, perfectly crafted diamonds and diamond jewellery.</p>
<p>MAIA is headed by Rajen Javeri and Sachin Ved, both of whom have decades of experience in diamond manufacturing and diamond jewellery &#8211; ranging from conceptualising designs to craftsmanship to an in-depth knowledge of the diamond business.</p>
<p>The Javeri family has been a trusted and reputed name in the business of diamond manufacturing and diamond jewellery since 1910.</p>
<p>Stylish yet affordable, contemporary and compelling &#8211; MAIA Fine Jewellery reflects and complements the changing tastes and lifestyle of the young, modern Indian woman who not only wants to look good, but also feel good about herself..</p>

<p>Every piece of the jewellery on display is testimony to the highest standards of workmanship and skill of experienced craftsmen.</p>
