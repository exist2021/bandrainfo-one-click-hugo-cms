<p>Arya Vidya Mandir is a well know school in Mumbai with branches in Bandra East, West and Juhu. For admissions to nursery, parents have to apply through a form. There is no interview in Arya Vidya Mandir School, Mumbai. Parents are directly notified through phone calls from Arya Vidya Mandir admissions office. The school is owned and run by Wadhwa Group.</p>
<p>It is a recommended school for parents who want to put their children in a good reputed ICSE board school. It is affiliated to Hinduism and Arya faith. The crowd is cosmopolitan with most parents from a professional background.</p>
<p>We hear that the admissions calls for confirmed applicants begin in second week of January and complete by end January. Important things to consider for admission.</p>
<ol>
<li>The admissions to nursery are decided only thorugh a form. Therefore fill the form thoughtfully.</li>
<li>Arya Vidya Mandir School, Mumbai is very strict about the PIN codes from which it accepts applicaitons. Check that before applying. Also if you shift your house to a non- eligible PIN code even while the child is in the school, AVM, Mumbai will ask you to move out</li>
<li>If you don’t get admission in nursery, don’t lose heart! AVM, Mumbai starts from nursery and you can try through a letter in Junior KG when some kids move out to other schools</li>
<li>Last, but not the least, thousands of parents apply to AVM and they only select a 100! Maybe the selection is random, or maybe its the form.</li>
</ol>
