<p><b>Bandra East Community Centre (BECC)</b> is a registered voluntary organization (NGO) founded by the <b>Norbertine Fathers</b> in the year <b>1974.</b></p>
<p>Through dynamic and innovative initiatives and projects, the organization has played an important role in improving the lives of several street children in the community, senior citizens and the local community by addressing and meeting their physical, emotional, educational and social needs.</p>
<p>The rehabilitation of the slum, now called the <b>Siddharth Colony</b> is the first major project undertaken by the BECC.</p>

<p>The organization works for the socio-economic development of the slum and pavement dwellers and renders its services, irrespective of caste, creed and religion with the sole objective of upliftment of the marginalized, the underprivileged, the downtrodden and the neglected in the society, who grapple with the insecurities of life.</p>
