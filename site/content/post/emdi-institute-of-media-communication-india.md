We spoke to industry stalwarts in event management and attempted to understand their needs. Curricula were structured to meet these industry defined needs, and lectures were largely delivered by industry practitioners themselves.</p>
<p>Today, EMDI alumni are in middle and senior management positions at virtually every event management company of repute. They study the craft in classrooms, train on events, and do internships with event management companies, with whom they are eventually placed.</p>
<p>Five years ago, we noticed that our Event Management students began to be sought after by public relations companies. Owing to the increasing interdependence of Events and PR, those with a background in events were beginning to be seen as vital assets by the PR industry. This trend led us to explore, and then establish, a range of courses in Event Management and Public Relations (PGDEMPR). Our PGDEMPR alumni are now found in virtually every leading PR and Event firm, testifying to the relevance of our curriculum.</p>
<p>More recently, we noticed that there was an acute shortage of candidates in the Advertising and Communication space. Considering that there was just a handful of educational institutes offering courses in this vertical, and taking into account industry needs, we launched the Post Graduate Diploma in Advertising and Communication (PGDAC) , which has not only lived up to the standards set by us, but has been instrumental in delivering job-ready winners for the field.</p>
<p>The growth in our bouquet of offerings has matched geographical growth. EMDI courses are now offered at centres in Mumbai (Bandra, Lower Parel, Thane and Jai Hind College), and across centres in India (Pune, Bangalore, Delhi and Kolkata) with additional centres being set up in Chennai, Hyderabad, Indore and Jaipur. On the international front, EMDI has been running its branch at Dubai Knowledge Village, a hub for education in the Middle East, for the past six years.</p>
<p>The EMDI Institute of Event Management was rechristened EMDI Institute of Media and Communication, to more closely reflect its wider educational canvas.</p>
<p>With courses in event management, public relations, advertising and journalism, we are proud to operate under the aegis of Greycells Education Limited, a Bombay Stock Exchange listed company.</p>
