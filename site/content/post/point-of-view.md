<p>Point of View was started in Bombay, India, in November 1997.<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/point-of-view.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1058 alignright" alt="point of view" src="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/point-of-view.jpg?resize=214%2C107&#038;ssl=1" width="214" height="107" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Point of View is a Mumbai-based non-profit platform that brings the points of view of women into community, social, cultural and public domains through media, art and culture. They work with grassroots or community partners to actualize their core belief: that each one of us has a right to a voice, in our lives, in our workplaces, and within ourselves.</p>
<p>If power hierarchies among men, women and trans people determine whose voice matters, the same hierarchies determine which women’s voices are heard more than others. They promote the voices of women who are marginalized due to their caste, class, ability, sexual orientation, work, gender identity – or simply because they are women.</p>
<p>They work across all offline and online platforms &#8211; and more and across five program areas:</p>
<p><b>Fighting For Headspace:</b> Placing the broad concept of gender in the public domain</p>
<p><b>Pushing The Boundaries:</b> Putting forward the realities of women in sex work as they see them</p>
<p><b>Speaking In Tongues:</b> Highlighting marginalized issues of gender, sexuality and rights</p>
<p><b>Defending Our Bodies:</b> Enabling women to speak out about and prevent domestic violence</p>
<p><b>Changing The Lens:</b> Building the capacities of grassroots women to express themselves through media platforms.</p>

<p>Point of View has been conducting interesting interactive campaigns all over the city to enlighten the issues in the world of women in the way of</p>
<p>Advertisements</p>
<p>Books</p>
<p>Campaigns</p>
<p>Consulting</p>
<p>Events</p>
<p>Films</p>
<p>Games</p>
<p>Photography</p>
<p>Publications</p>
<p>Theatre</p>
<p>Online</p>
<p>Workshops</p>
<p>They have enabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Women in low-income urban slums to speak out about domestic violence (breaking the silence around abuse is the first step in preventing it)</li>
<li>Women in sex work to reposition their realities through a different lens (counting women in sex work as &#8216;women&#8217;, &#8216;human&#8217; ‘citizens’ is a critical step for them to access rights)</li>
<li>Women who are HIV-positive or mentally disabled to share their life experiences (understanding women&#8217;s realities is a key step in ensuring that women get the care and support they need)</li>
<li>Marginalized women to tell their own stories in their own voices (empowering grassroots women to express or represent themselves is a vital step in ensuring lasting social change)</li>
</ul>
