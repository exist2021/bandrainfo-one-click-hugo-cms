<p dir="auto">Dinesh D’souza was in news recently for mocking the florida school surviors. Though he has apologised on the tweet below. It is interesting to see a journey of a person from Bandra to being a former advisor to Reagan. So let us look at Dinesh D’souza past to know him better.</p>

<blockquote><p>Are you mystified on about how this bandra boy Dinesh D&#8217;Souza developed his world view. ?</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Blame it on Dartmouth.<br />
The Ivy League college, a bastion of conservatism, threw open an intellectual world that he had never before been exposed to. &#8220;I think the most startling thing for me was the discovery that ideas matter.. that books can make us wiser about life than experience&#8221; he says, recalling his undergrad years.</p>
<p>The wide-eyed novice became a ready receptacle for whatever ideas came his way &#8220;and they happened to be very right-wing ones. He became friends with a group of conservative students who convinced him that the left was too cynical. By and by, his essays in the notoriously conservative a Dartmouth Review&#x2122; got noticed by the then Reagan administration and he was invited to join the White House as a policy analyst. The die was cast. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Bandra-boy-insists-west-is-indeed-the-best/articleshow/19398765.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more.</a></p>
