Individuals and communities are hungering for ways, new and old, to build connections, to go beyond &#8220;them&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221;, to heal self, others and the planet. Amid the glamour and clamour for material goods all of us are longing to plumb the depths of stillness and silence.  All over the universe there are signs that nature is calling us back to ourselves, calling us back home.</p>

<p>The Retreat House, a Centre for Wholeness, inspires being ‘contemplative in action’ to co-create fullness of life for all.  Nestling in sylvan surroundings and overlooked by the Shrine of Our Lady of the Mount on the top and the Bandstand promenade below, the space popularly known as the “Retreat House” provides a calm and conducive environment for silence and solitude, prayer and reflection.  It was founded in 1931 through the untiring efforts of the late Fr. Adrian Le Tellier, SJ, a Belgian Jesuit belonging to the Calcutta Jesuit Province, who sought to incarnate the Ignatian charism. Following in the footsteps of St. Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus, it is our pleasure and privilege to explore new frontiers of spiritual ministry for our times. A space, a place, a dream, an unfolding reality which fosters universal sister/brotherhood for global peace and cosmic harmony.</p>
