<p dir="auto">Recently I went for a free method-acting workshop last Sunday and was very impressed by the kind of efforts the guys at Jeff Goldberg Studio are putting up. Though I thought it was a fun way to spend a Sunday afternoon, most of the people who were present there were aspiring actors and a married lady had travelled all the way from Navi Mumbai to attend the free workshop.</p>
<p>I think Mr Goldberg is doing a fantastic job at the Studio. I would encourage anyone who is seriously into the arts to at least try the free Sunday Workshop; it sure is fun! Also Big thanks to Harsh who was the instructor for the workshop for being such an excellent facilitator. </p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are dead serious about a career in acting, then you could check out the course details at the Studio.</p>
<blockquote><p>The acting program is broken up into three (3) separate workshops:<br />Foundation (1-3 months)<br />Intermediate (4-6 months)*<br />Advanced (7-9 months)*<br />&nbsp;<br />Each of the workshops is designed to specifically work on the various facets of working as an actor.&nbsp;Ever student begins in the Foundation Workshop. Each workshop is constructed in a fashion that teaches a series and set of tools for each actor to employ professionally.<br />&nbsp;<br />For specific information about each workshop please click any of the links below or see our&nbsp;FAQ. If you would like to receive a copy of any of our workshops syllabus please email us at:&nbsp;info@jgstudio.in<br /><cite> &#8211; via <a href="https://www.jgstudio.in/about3">Jeff Goldberg Studio</a></cite></p></blockquote>
