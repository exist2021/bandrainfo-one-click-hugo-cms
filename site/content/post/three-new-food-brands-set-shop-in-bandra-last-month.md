<h3>Keventers</h3>
<p dir="auto">A famous Delhi brand seems to have reinvented and revived itself and come to Carters. Going by the popularity I presume there are plenty of Delhiites in Bandra?</p>

<h3>Breadcraft</h3>
<p dir="auto">If Delhi comes to bandra, can Lokhandwala be far behind? This brand goes back about 25 years, but has a fierce following for their Frankie. So go out and check them out at 16th road, bang opposite Khane Khaas or next to Annapoorna 16th road.</p>

<h3>Filli Cafe</h3>
<p>Filli Cafe a popular UAE chain opens its 2nd Mumbai outlet at Carters. The outlet size is extremely small, but the concept seems interesting, their tag line ‘A cup of tea makes everything better.’ I look forward to checking them out. They have pocket friendly combo offers like vadapav and chai.</p>
