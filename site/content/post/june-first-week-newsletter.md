<h2 id="a-50-yr-old-banyan-tree-replanted_2">A 50-yr-old Banyan Tree Replanted</h2>

We rarely see such a sight where residents, BMC and an NGO work together and save a life. This time it was saving an old Banyan Tree. There is this amazing organisation in Hyderabad called [Vaata Foundation](http://www.vatafoundation.org), which helped replant a [50 year old Banyan tree](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/7330344uprooted-in-tauktae-aftermath-50-yr-old-banyan-tree-finds-a-new-home-on-bandra-promenade/) Bandra Promenade. The tree was uprooted during cyclone Tauktae. Check the replanting [video here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPXgyTiJpUz/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).

<h2 id="budweiser-replaces-the-messi-painting-with-asha-parekh-waheeda-rehman-and-helen_3">Budweiser replaces the Messi Painting with Asha Parekh, Waheeda Rehman and Helen</h2>

After the desecration of the iconic Anarkali painting by a commercial Messi painting, Budweiser [commissione](https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/bollywood-art-project-mural-asha-parekh-waheeda-rehman-helen-7330868/)d a new project to BAP and had a new painting made. This time it is Asha Parekh, Waheeda Rehman and Helen in Chapel Road in Bandra.

I wonder how all the [negative reviews](__GHOST_URL__/budweisers-messi-painting-replaces-the-anarkali-painting/) hurt Budweiser's brand image, but they acted quickly and did damage control quite well. This would be a case study for brands that try to create culture and end up doing more damage to themselves and the culture they are trying to influence.
