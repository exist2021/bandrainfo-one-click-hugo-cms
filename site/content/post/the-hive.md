<p>We are an urban center for the arts and technology spread over three floors and 4500 square feet in the heart of Bandra. Think of us as one giant lab/playground inside a fantastical magical bungalow just off Carter Road. We are a one of a kind eco-system with integrated state-of-the art facilities that support performance spaces (with one indoor and one outdoor area), a recording studio, a workshop and seminar space, and co-working and collaborative offices for start-ups and entrepreneurs and an organic cafe.</p>
<p>We love growing and cultivating young talent, and curate some incredible shows all week long with some of the most talented and dedicated artists in the country. We also facilitate workshops conducted by some of the most forward thinking educators of our generation. And there&#8217;s also a good amount of fitness, dance, yoga and spiritual enlightenment thrown in for good measure. Drop by the Hive to enjoy a workshop, read a book, watch a show, finish that project or just to sit down to sip on a quiet cup of coffee. The Hive has been built to nurture your mind, body and soul. Trust us when we say this, at the Hive, you will discover something different everyday.</p>
