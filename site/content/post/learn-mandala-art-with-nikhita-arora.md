Nikhita Arora is a self-taught Mandala artist. She is a proud born and raised in Bandra girl.

## Can you please introduce Madala Art in your own words?

I always believed that everything in life is connected and that the chaos of the mind is always expressed best through art. Three years back I stumbled across the art form of Mandala, and since then life has never been the same!

Mandalas works on the principle of ‚Äòrepeating patterns in a circle to channel your ‚Äòinner chaos and anxiety‚Äô. It is addictive because of the calm and controls it brings to the mind.

On the inner level, Mandalas have not just helped me be more organized and channelize my energy, but it has also helped me grow as an artist.

Mandalas are a form of meditative art and have a proven effect on controlling anxiety. And the most beautiful part is that anyone can make one. You don‚Äôt need to be an artist, all you need is to be able to focus and some basic tools.

This is the reason why I want to spread this art form because let‚Äôs face it, we all are struggling with mental health this year. Why not use it to create a beautiful piece of art which also reminds us of our strengths and victories?

### Wikipedia Definition of Mandal

## What do you love about Bandra?

I love how Bandra looks prettier each year especially during Christmas and the way the streets light up during Christmas. I love the amazing graffiti on the inner lanes of Hill Road and Pali, the eateries are hidden in every corner such as Candies, or Andoras, and of course, the coffee that comes on the cycle at Bandstand and Carter road, one can just not get enough.

## What are your favourite places to shop/eat/hangout in Bandra?

My most favourite place to eat in Bandra is Candies! I just love everything about the place from the vibe to the food. Any person who stays in Bandra will know that there is no other place like Candies.

My most favourite place to shop is Hill Road, especially during the festive season. It can brighten up even a dull day! Every corner of the road is lit up, with a carnival-like festive feel all around. The other place I can‚Äôt get enough of is Title waves. Situated in one of the many lanes of Bandra, this place is any reader‚Äôs paradise. 

## Give is a Bandra secret or an anecdote or peculiarities of a Bandra person :)?

Only a Bandra person will know:

1. Where 14th road or 16th road is situated

2. The burgers and rolls at Hersh Bakery ARE DIFFERENT

3. Bandra is home to some of the best restaurants tucked away in some of the ‚Äòhardest to find‚Äô by-lanes. Eg. Seeds of Life, Blues Kitchen, Birdsong Caf√©, and so many more

4. There is a mini Goa situated in Bandra

5. You will find everything you need/wants within two lanes away. Even florists!

And yes, a person from Bandra will ALWAYS pronounce Bandra differently than the others üòâ
