<p class="p19"><span class="s1" style="color: #00ccff;"><b>TOOTH WHITENING:</b></span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-7614" src="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/teeth-whitening.jpg?resize=311%2C162&#038;ssl=1" alt="teeth whitening" width="311" height="162" data-recalc-dims="1" />Don’t hesitate to smile because of your yellow, stained, dull teeth….. tooth whitening is the perfect solution to a dazzling smile with shining white brilliant teeth!! The procedure involves application of whitening gels containing hydrogen peroxide which oxidize the stains and remove them completely. We offer two types of tooth whitening procedures:</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1"><b>In Office Bleach:</b> 45-60 minutes is all it takes to get that sparkle in your smile that you have always wanted !! It is done under our supervision where the gums and other soft tissues are isolated and well protected before application of the whitening gel, followed by activation of the gel with a Plasma /LED light. The results are instantaneous and you can walk out with the perfect smile.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1"><b>At Home Bleach: </b>Customized transparent trays are prepared to fit the teeth which hold the whitening gel, to be worn at night. Since Home bleach gels contain a lower concentration of hydrogen peroxide, the whitening process is slower as compared to the In-office power bleach technique.</span></p>

<p class="p16"><span class="s7"><b><span style="color: #00ccff;">VENEERS:</span></b></span><span class="s1"><span style="color: #00ccff;"> </span><br />
Veneers are thin shells of porcelain which are bonded to the tooth surface in order to alter the size, shape, shade, position and overall appeal of the tooth. Veneers can be fabricated to correct the following:-</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Stained Teeth</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Chipped Teeth</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Misaligned Teeth</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Protruded Teeth</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Rotated Teeth</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Gaps in Teeth</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Smile which is not in harmony with the facial structures</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="s1" style="color: #00ccff;"><b>Veneers are a one-time solution to enhance your smile and get your confidence boosted !!</b></span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s7"><b><span style="color: #00ccff;">REHABILLITATION OF GUMS:</span> </b></span><span class="s1">Sometimes gums look blackish or brownish due to excessive pigmentation. This can be corrected with a minor surgical procedure which involves stripping off the superficial layer of the gums and allowing healing with secondary intention, resulting in healthy pink and evenly coloured gums. </span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">The gums ideally encircle the neck of the teeth in a half moon shape. If this shape is distorted it gives a very unpleasant and abnormal appearance. This condition can be corrected with a procedure called gingivoplasty which is nothing but shaping and contouring of the gums giving a more natural and younger look to the gums.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s7" style="color: #00ccff;"><b>BONDING: </b></span><span class="s1"><br />
This is a one sitting procedure in which thin layers of composite material are bonded to the tooth surface in order to correct problems in the teeth such as:-</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Chips</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Fractures</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Gaps</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Stains</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">We use the finest techniques and brands of composite materials, thus enabling us to mimic tooth structure to the tee and allow no distinction to the human eye between the natural tooth structure and the added composite material. The Procedure is long lasting as the material is durable and as easy to maintain as your natural tooth structure.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="s1" style="color: #00ccff;"><b>SMILE MAKE-OVER:</b></span></p>
<p class="p20"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><span class="s1"><b><i><span style="color: #ff0000;">BEAUTIFUL SMILES</span> </i></b></span><span class="s8"><b><i>BEGIN HERE !!</i></b></span></span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Let us help you to let go of all inhibitions and smile your heart’s fullest!!</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">We start with a one on one consultation process to understand the patients personality and attitude as a whole followed by a thorough examination and in depth discussion of the patient’s expectation of a perfect smile. There are various procedures carried out on your front teeth, either directly by the cosmetic dentist or indirectly fabricated by the laboratories to enhance your smile quotient.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">ARE YOU A CANDIDATE FOR A SMILE MAKEOVER ??</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Are you conscious of your smile for any reason</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Do you ever put your hand up to cover your smile</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Do you wish you had whiter teeth</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Do you look through magazines or at other people , envious of their smiles</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Do you show too much of your gums when you smile</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Are any of your teeth very prominent</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Are your teeth crooked or misaligned</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Are there multiple gaps in your teeth</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Do you show too little or too much teeth when you smile</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Are your teeth stained or have an unpleasant shade or shape</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Do you have missing front teeth</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Do you have crowns or veneers with dark shadows near the gums</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Did you consider braces for that perfect smile and then give up the idea</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">If you answered yes to one or more of the above then cosmetic dental procedures could be the way to go….. to get that perfect smile you always wanted !!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s7" style="color: #00ccff;"><b>Kshitij Shah</b></span><span class="s1"> (NSE Share Broker): There is a famous saying, “a smile says a thousand words”. I have always been conscious about my smile as I had really short teeth, which were almost negligible upon smiling. Dr. Motwani suggested me a Smile Makeover. My family and I agreed on the procedure because of her professionalism, cleanliness, and state of the art equipment. She is extremely knowledgeable, and experienced in her field of dentistry cosmetry. She made me comfortable, explained each step during the procedure. In about two weeks the procedure was completed, and my teeth looked amazing. Now I can truly say, my smile says a thousand words.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s7" style="color: #00ccff;"><b>Kinjal Bhutala</b></span><span class="s1"> (Cardivascular and Pulmonary nurse- Florida): Initially I was a little wary of coming to India and getting cosmetic treatment for my deficient smile. But when I saw the ambience and hygiene combined with great quality of dentistry with a highly professional approach, I was convinced. And surely the overall outcome didn&#8217;t let me down at all. I smile my fullest now, all thanks to Dr. Krinita and her awesome staff.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s7"><b><span style="color: #00ccff;">Archana Gore</span> </b></span><span class="s1">(Housewife): I was so troubled by one ugly yellow tooth right in front of my mouth. I consulted a lot of dentists and tried many different treatments but nothing helped. Finally I heard of Dr. Krinita from my friend and visited her. She explained the various options to me in detail with the pros and cons which allowed me to participate in the treatment process. I was extremely thrilled with the success. Now I can smile without having to cover my face!</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s7"><b><span style="color: #00ccff;">Jaya Jain</span> </b></span><span class="s1">(Principal Consultant- Talisman Advisors): My job profile requires me to interview people a lot during which I was very conscious of my smile. After receiving a smile makeover from Dr. Krinita, I now have perfectly straight and white teeth. I am much more confident and happy !! The outcome of my treatment definitely fulfills my expectations. Thank you very much</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="s7"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><b>Sarika Mohandas</b></span> </span><span class="s1">(House wife ): I have been to several dentists in the past &amp; this time I had some extensive treatment done with Dr. Krinita. I liked the fact that I was informed on the course of treatment at every stage. She was very gentle &amp; caring. A good explanation of my treatment &amp; what I should expect ensured that there were no surprises. The attention &amp; follow up calls to know how I&#8217;m feeling were very warm.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="s7"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><b>Pallavi Lakdawala</b></span> </span><span class="s1">(Social worker with Akanksha): Had severe pain in a wisdom tooth &amp; surrounding teeth but due to the much greater fear factor of dental treatment had avoided any visits to a dentist.

My mantra now onwards is to treat teeth and have no tension when you have a Dentist like Dr. Krinita.</span></p>

Above all there is so much of care with excellence.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="s7" style="color: #00ccff;"><b>Nikita Khatija</b></span><span class="s1"> (Housewife / Mother): I received 10 veneers crafted with expertise by Dr. Krinita Motwani and all in one day.

<p class="p7"><span class="s7" style="color: #00ccff;"><b>Leah Nelson</b></span><span class="s1"> (PHD-Economics- San diego-USA): I have always had a fear of dentists since I was 10 years old because of which I avoided going to one for a long time.

I had extensive treatment done over 9 months involving root canals, bridge work and teeth whitening……all PAIN FREE !!</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="s7" style="color: #00ccff;"><b>Asha Thawani </b></span><span class="s1">(House wife): Only the required and best treatment was suggested after proper investigation.
