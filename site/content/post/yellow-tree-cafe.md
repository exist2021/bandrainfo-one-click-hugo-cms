<p>With a stylish ambience and consistently good food, Yellow Tree Café continues to attract and bring back patrons.</p>
<p>The Chef’s unique style and mastery creates a divine experience with food that can send you into raptures of pleasure.</p>
<p>The menu compliments Herb roasted vegetables and mozzarella Sandwiches with a choice of bread focacia, multigrain, baguette or whole wheat, tenderloin mince burgers or the wurstel hot dog.</p>
<p>Start with smoked Norwegian Salmon platter to sundried tomatoes and olive crostini, hummus and pita and move on to a more elaborate main course of nonvegetarian menu of sphagetti Bolognese, grilled Norwegian salmon or Vietnamese basa or choose from a milder vegetarian sphagetti aglio olio, basil ravioli of oven dried tomato and olives, all at a single restaurant completing the gourmet experience.</p>
<p>Detox with a seasonal fruit, sunflower seed, beans sprout and taste the banoffee pie which would take you through an impressive culinary journey.</p>
<p>You can sip your margarita or a martini in the cosy little bar that is quite appealing as a meet up place.</p>
<p>That’s one more reason to head there.</p>
