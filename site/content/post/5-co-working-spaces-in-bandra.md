<p dir="ltr">I have never tried working from a co-working space. But since I have been working from home for last 10 years or so, I have been curious on co-working space. Recently I went out calling in search of co-working spaces. There are few aggregators for co-working spaces now, which do make your work easier.</p>
<p>To be honest, co-working spaces options in Bandra are very limited. Here are a few I could dug out for you. There are many more options in BKC, which will need a separate post. Also there is one at Santacruz West near Starbucks and another one near Mahim station.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This place will screen your profile to see whether you qualify. The admission process is a bit tiresome, so I have never got around to apply for a space. However, I have been here for an event, and see that the place is vibrant and buzzing with community spirit. This could be a great place to work if you are someone who doesn&#8217;t feel productive working out from home.</p>

<p dir="ltr">There is one-room for the co-working space and a very good deal for the price and flexibility. It is in the same place as cuckoo club.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pricing &#8211;<br />
They give the place on daily(Rs 500/weekly 2000/monthly (Rs7000) basis.</p>
<p>Amenities &#8211;<br />
Unlimited High Speed Wifi and unlimited tea/coffee</p>
<p>Terms &amp; Conditions &#8211;<br />

<h2>Social offline</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2669_2_full.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2669_2.jpg?resize=630%2C320&#038;ssl=1" width="630" height="320" align="middle" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Social Offline has good food and unlimited wifi. The only downside is the place is dark and grungy. We need office places nicely lit up. This is not something for the regular diligent worker.<br />
The best part is that all your membership charges are redeemable for drinks and food. Also you can use your membership in any of the social offline in Mumbai or in the country.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Terms &amp; Conditions</p>
<p>There are selection criteria where you have to fill in a <a href="https://socialoffline.in/workspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">form here</a> . After which their community manager will test to see if you match their profile.</p>
