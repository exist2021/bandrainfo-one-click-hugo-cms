<p style="color: #2b2b2b;">Ah……where in Mumbai do you go when you want to have a leisurely lunch in a classy setting? Our choice last Saturday was Smoke House Deli in Bandra.</p>
<p style="color: #2b2b2b;">Located right at the end of the KFC street in Bandra,Smoke House Deli wasn’t difficult to find, except that we were very hungry by the time we reached there and were almost begging for quick service.</p>

<p style="color: #2b2b2b;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: inherit;">And so, first, about the food at Smoke House Deli</span> — we hurriedly ordered a plate of sea-food fries over Red Sangria, White Wine and Sweet Lime Soda. Devoured them when they arrived. My 6-yr old loved the prawn fritters. For the mains, we went for Smoked Lamb Shanks for myself, Wild Mushroom Risotto for the daughter and Mother-in-law, Honey Orange Glazed Pork Ribs for Jayanta. The Risotto was Yumm!!!! Jayant loved the pork dish too and kept raving about the sauce all through. I was delighted with my plate of lamb……they were so tender and so perfectly cooked!! The sauce however lacked taste and was quite bland. Wish they had served it with Prune Jus or something similar. Pity that such a tender made lamb was found lacking in its sauce.</p>
<p style="color: #2b2b2b;">Desserts was a combination of Philly Cheesecake with Plum Sauce and Apple Crumble with Vanilla Ice-Cream. Plum sauce was a little too sour. But rest, were a perfect end to an otherwise good meal.</p>
