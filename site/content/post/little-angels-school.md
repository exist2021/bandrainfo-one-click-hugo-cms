We believe in working towards the growth of every child and provide them with more and better facilities and this is achievable only through the contributions made by generous supporters.</p>
<p>It has been our endeavor to cater to the needs of Special children, and to fulfill their aspiration for education. There are times, however, when parents of these children are not able to provide for them.</p>
<p>Realizing the importance of timely intervention in children, Little Angels does its best to help children who cannot afford education. Even with our limited means, we try and provide whatever we can. Some of the children are helped with tuition fees, some with uniforms, books, transportation, etc.</p>
<p><b>Admissions:</b></p>
<p>Accepting the Childs difficulties and making the first move to provide special education to the child is a daunting task. Here at Little Angels we understand the emotions of a parent taking this step. We are here to help.</p>
<p>Our team of Special Educators and the Administrative Team guides the parents through the Admission Process.</p>
<p>We Provide Admission to children facing the given challenges..</p>

<p>In preparing our curriculum, we have sought out the best practices teaching programs and examination boards (NIOS). The information given here outlines the broad aims of our teaching at different levels in order to provide an idea of how a child will progress at Little Angels School.</p>
<p>Special education is the individually planned and systematically monitored arrangement of teaching procedures, adapted equipment and materials, accessible settings, and other interventions designed to help learners with special needs achieve a higher level of personal self-sufficiency and success in school and community than would be available if the student were only given access to a typical classroom education.</p>
