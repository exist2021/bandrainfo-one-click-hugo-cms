<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>Many who grew up watching Bruce Lee movies, trained in martial arts which advocated punishing practices in body conditioning, to achieve a warrior-like status.</p>
<p>Today, the world needs no further aggression than it already has, but safe practice &amp; diversion of aggression, towards a more harmonious society.</p>
<p>In 2006, an arts teacher at the American School of Mumbai, Brian Reverman, began teaching Aikido in Mumbai.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC0402_r_full.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC0402_r.jpg?resize=850%2C445&#038;ssl=1" align="middle" width="850" height="445" class="aligncenter" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His passion, attracted diverse students &#8211; executives, collegians &amp; security professionals including, most interestingly&#8230; the Director of Security of the American School himself DB Rai, who was then already a 5th Dan black belt in Gojyuryu Karate, under Shihan Pervez Mistry.</p>
<p>The hard-core karateka in DB Rai (now a 2nd Dan Black Belt in Aikido), questioned its practicality, only to discover that when Aikido techniques were well executed, even the gentle, could overcome the strong.</p>
<p>He was hooked &amp; in 2010, when Brian Sensei left for China, DB Rai took charge as Chief Instructor.</p>
<h3>Aikido in Mumbai Today</h3>
<p>Thanks to DB Sensei&#8217;s wonderful international associations with the security &amp; martial arts community, the dojo now attracts senior instructors from across the world, who visit &amp; conduct training seminars for its students &amp; also Japanese instructors from the Hombu dojo in Tokyo, who grade &amp; certify its members.</p>

<h3>What you can learn</h3>
<p>Regardless of your age, gender or size, you can learn to first get out of the way of an aggressors force and then redirect that aggression with a variety of pinning, locking &amp; throwing techniques.</p>
<p>Aikido does not train students to compete with others, rather&#8230; to be a better version of their own earlier selves.</p>
