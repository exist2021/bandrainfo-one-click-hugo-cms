<p> I moved houses, I wanted minimum downtime so I started hunting for broadband connection, someone who would install the broadband on the same day. </p>
<p>Being a loyal MTNL customer, my first stop was MTNL, they told me it would take 3/4 days and then they declined saying the phone cannot be transferred so I might have to opt for new connection. This was useless. So after a couple of Tweets i was told some guy called Brian would install me a connection within 4 hours. </p>
<p>I called Brian and Wincable one after another. The lady at Brian told me she would get back and never bothered to call back. But Ranjeet from Wincable called me back in half an hour saying he can do the connection the same day. By 6.45 pm my broadband was installed and tested, I have opted for 16 Mbps plan with 100 GB and validity for 3 months. ( See the speed test results pic above) </p>
<p>If you are looking for same day installation call Ranjeet from Wincable, this is his mobile number 9004680121 </p>
