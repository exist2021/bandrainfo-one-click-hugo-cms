[Prem Sokhi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/premsokhi/) always surprises me with his knowledge of the F&B industry. If you want to know what is happening where in the F&B sector, he won't dissapoint you. He is the founder of Azzure Inc, a company that specializes in F&B consultancy and Real Estate advisory. Prem has been working for 18 years now and has a background in IT, Media and Restaurants.

## Please introduce yourself in your own words.

Hi, I’m Prem Sokhi and I’m the founder of Azzure Inc, a company that specializes in F&B consultancy and Real Estate advisory. My family has been in the hospitality industry since 30+ years and my heart was always in that business having spent my entire childhood in restaurants and kitchens and experimenting with food all my life. My father is based in Japan where he has an Indian restaurant. Soon after I completed my education in Mumbai and then in LA, I moved to Japan, where I spent 7 years training under him. Japan was awesome but somehow Mumbai was calling out to me and I decided to return back to base. It was then when I set up Azzure, which specialised in providing tech solutions to media & entertainment companies. But as my true calling was always “food”, I now specialise in F&B consultancy and Real Estate, mostly for brands in the hospitality industry.

## How long here you been living in Bandra?

Its been 8 years. Bandra has been home since 2012.

## What are your favourite restaurants & hangouts in Bandra?

Quite a few. But some that top the list are; Eat Around the Corner, Smokehouse Deli, Pali Bhavan, Out of the Blue, Monkey Bar, Farmers Cafe, Bombay Salad Company.

## I see you in Matunga a lot, do you prefer Matunga over Bandra?

I was born and bought up in that area, hence it’s close to my heart. I miss spending time at the simple, all time favourite Udupi joints like Café Madras, Ram Ashray, Arya Bhavan and Ramanayak and keep going back for the filter coffee and the South Indian food which is the best in Mumbai. I love the calmness and slow life of Matunga, as much as I love the energy and pace of Bandra. But now to a large extent and for several reasons, I love Bandra.

## What do you think Bandra needs desperately?

Bandra is organized chaos. But what it desperately needs is better roads, less hawkers, affordable housing and less hype.

## Tell us a Bandra secret?

Bandra has a couple of underground hangouts. Don’t ask me the details.
