<p><strong><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/aa.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-709 alignright" src="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/aa.jpg?resize=278%2C181&#038;ssl=1" alt="aa" width="278" height="181" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong>Alcoholics Anonymous is an international fellowship of men and women who once had a drinking problem. It is nonprofessional, self-supporting, nondenominational, apolitical, and available almost everywhere. There is no age or educational requirement. Membership is open to anyone who wants to do something about his or her drinking problem.</p>
<p>WHAT DOES A.A. DO?</p>
<p>A.A. members share their experience with anyone seeking help with a drinking problem; they give person-to-person service or &#8220;sponsorship&#8221; to the alcoholic coming to A.A. from any source.</p>
<p>The A.A. programme, set forth in Twelve Steps, offers the alcoholic a way to develop a satisfying life without alcohol.</p>
<p><b>WHAT A.A. DOES NOT DO ?</b></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Furnish initial motivation for alcoholics to recover</li>
<li>Solicit members</li>
<li>Engage in or sponsor research</li>
<li>Keep attendance records or case histories</li>
<li>Join &#8220;councils&#8221; of social agencies</li>
<li>Follow up or try to control its members</li>
<li>Make medical or psychological diagnoses or prognoses</li>
<li>Provide drying-out or nursing services, hospitalization, drugs, or any medical or psychiatric treatment</li>
<li>Offer religious services</li>
<li>Engage in education about alcohol</li>
<li>Provide housing, food, clothing, jobs, money, or any other welfare or social services</li>
<li>Provide domestic or vocational counselling</li>
<li>Accept any money for its services, or any contributions from non-A.A. sources</li>
<li>Provide letters of reference to parole boards, lawyers, court officials, social agencies, employers, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>The primary purpose of A.A. is to carry the message of recovery to the alcoholic seeking help. Almost every alcoholism treatment tries to help the alcoholic maintain sobriety. Regardless of the road we follow, we all head for the same destination, recovery of the alcoholic person. Together, we can do what none of us could accomplish alone. We can serve as a source of personal experience and be an ongoing support system for recovering alcoholics.</p>
