<p>If you love eating until you need to be rolled home, you will love Gondola.</p>
<p>Be it a non vegetarian choice of fish, prawns, mutton, steak, chicken or vegetable, the sizzlers and the Chinese here are extremely popular. Gondola’s beef/ chicken chilli burger makes this a favourite place to dine for many. The tom yum soup and the lemon grass soup are excellent, and the Gondola special soup is a must try.</p>
<p>Gondola’s is the best food around, for almost four decades. Perizad Zorabian he actress&#8217;s father started this place about 38 years ago.  The food at Gondola is fresh, arrives roasting hot to your table and the presentation is appealing enough to boost your appetite and make you desire a second serving.</p>
<p>Gondola serves perfectly cooked food with one of the best and freshest salads. They offer daily specials that give you meals that are wonderfully filling.</p>
<p>With choices of chicken cooked more than 12 different ways, the menu is huge with rice, noodles, chopsuey, chowmein or if you are looking for a quick choice, go for the mini meals with salad and add-ons. For the price which is slightly on the higher side, the choices are excellent.</p>
<p>Plus, once you have finished all the goodies, go for some dessert &#8211; kulfi or honey noodles with ice cream, it is delicious.</p>
<p>Pink Panther, Beach Bomber, Mocha Chilato…. Are not at all disappointing and make sure you don’t miss the cocktails.</p>
<p>Remember that if you go during peak lunch or dinner times, just look for the long line.</p>
<p>For the amount of fabulous food you are able to eat, the Gondola sizzler menu offers the best deals.</p>
<p>Pleasant ambience, good music, happy diners around…what else can you ask for?</p>
<p>Eat much as you want here.</p>
