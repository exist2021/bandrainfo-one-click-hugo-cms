<p dir="ltr">Bandra-ites have been complaining for a long time for a good place to watch movies. The people here had primarily two choices between Globus and Suburbia. As of now, I think both are down for maintenance. Somehow the people here don&#8217;t fancy “Gaiety Galaxy Gemini” which still feels it is stuck in the 80’s. There are also news of Salman Khan starting his brand of a chain of single screen cinemas starting with Bandra and Juhu, but not sure when that would be launching if at all, the news is accurate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I saw we are hiring board outside Globus Cinemas, with the entire structure under redevelopment. It seems that Sathyam cinemas will be taking over Globus, hope this provides relief to the Bandra movie goers and satisfies their needs.</p>
