<p>From Lisa Ray&#8217;s fb page</p>
<p>This is at mtnl building at #bandra reclamation. It&#8217;s 125 ft high and 150 ft wide. Total: 18,750 sq ft. Probably the biggest mural in india. So far the building has absorbed 400 ltrs of yellow paint, thanks to #asianpaints for unlimited supply. Ranjit Dahiya from B.A.P ( Bollywood Art Project) is going to work on this wall along with other painters.</p>
