<p> Kadeshwari Devi Temple is a Hindu temple located in Bandra, Mumbai, India. The temple is dedicated to mother goddess Kadeshwari situated on the top of hill behind Bandra Fort in Land&#39;s End, Banstand, Mumbai.</p>
<p>The idol of mother goddess Kadeshwari is in the form of Shakti. It is approximately 2 kilometers from Bandra railway station.</p>
<p>Due to the sea water constantly eroding the foundation of the temple and of the peripheral walls of the Bandra Fort, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had plans to construct a bund in 2006.</p>
