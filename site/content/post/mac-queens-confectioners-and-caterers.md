<p>Mac Queens traces its roots back to the 1970&#8217;s when it operated as Mac Ronells (founded by the late Mr. Cajetan Pereira).</p>
<p>The Business was handed down by Mr. Cajetan Pereira who set very high standards of food quality in Mumbai, to his daughter Mrs. Cynthia Pereira-Ferreira who single handedly changed the face of the Catering Industry in Mumbai.</p>
<p>Even after the passing of Mrs. Cynthia Pereira-Ferreira the legacy of Mac Ronells/Mac Queens is carried on with great pride.</p>
