Introducing House of Cure, India's 1st dedicated Medical Co-working Space and Training Centre for every kind of healthcare professional.

## Why Co-Working:

If consumers have gotten comfortable sharing car rides, office space, and apartments, then healthcare professionals can get comfortable sharing their practice space with some of their contemporaries.

Doctors/ therapists/ trainers definitely have to think a little differently about how they operate, but they can **save a lot of money on upfront capital expenses and ongoing monthly overhead if they are willing to make a few tweaks in their thinking.**

Now you need not worry about the hassle of looking for an ideal space, shredding hefty costs on lease agreements, paying huge rent/ EMI or bearing the administrative overheads.

## Importance of the right location:

For a doctor, choosing the **location** of the **clinic** is a decision as **important** as deciding the specialized stream of study. A **good location** for your **clinic** can take your medical practice to newer heights, while an average **location** could keep you in oblivion. With this in mind, House of Cure is located at Linking road, Bandra/ Khar west, a very central and prime location, accessible, easy to locate with no work time limitations.Flexibility and comfort for H.O.C. members:

Consistent with the flexibility and convenience that general coworking spaces provide, House of Cure offers the ability to **book and access the medical space they need for short amounts of time.** Practitioners can book the space for as small as an hour without having to pay monthly rent when the space is only being occupied only a few hours a week/ month. With this concept, we are determined to create a patient-centric treatment approach living up to our motto; Happy patients = Happy Doctors
