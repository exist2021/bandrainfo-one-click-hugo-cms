<p>Every Sunday afternoon sees happy families toodle into Soul Fry for a relaxed lunch and some live music which has for a long time been a rare sight in this otherwise lively city. </p>
<p><a   href="https://maps.apple.com/place?address=Pali%20Mala%20Road%2C%20Bandra%20West%2C%20Mumbai%2C%20Maharashtra%20400050%2C%20India&#038;auid=4599870825813253988&#038;ll=19.06295954461212%2C72.82797753810883&#038;q=Soul%20Fry">Soul Fry</a> is reviving those good ole days that will give the city a glimpse into the once-upon-a-time Bombay&#8230; and for those who had the good fortune of being there at the time, a nostalgic tug at the strings of memory.  It’s the friendliest jam in town&#8211;where musicians feel a sense of musical community rather than competition and guests are welcome to use the open mike.</p>
<p>Well known musicians such as, Desmond Taylor, Ernie Flanagan Raymond Albuquerque, Melanie Duggal and Walter Pereira have performed in the last one month and we promise a host of many more talented musicians to come. The month of August will see Dr. J and Bongo Man, Sigfred Dias, Rashna Alphonso and more performing at Soul Fry.</p>
<p>While the food at Soul Fry has stood the test of time you can avail of exciting offers from the bar during every Sunday’s lunch time jam sessions. Soul Fry has the best Bombay Duck in town and their prawn curry is quite legendary. Their other signature dishes include chicken cafreal and fish curry with rice. Even vegetarians can enjoy their delicious dal fry and zeera aloo. And all the food here comes at very reasonable prices. </p>
<p>If you don’t want to stay for lunch, just grab a drink and enjoy the music and at no cover charge! Something for everyone seems to be Soul Fry’s motto! Make sure you don’t miss these exciting lunch time live music sessions that happen every Sunday! So do head to</p>
