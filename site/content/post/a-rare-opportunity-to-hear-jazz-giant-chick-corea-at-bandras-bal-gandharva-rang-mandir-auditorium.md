<h3>By Manju Sampat</h3>
<p>November 3rd this year will be a very special day for music lovers. Chick Corea who has attained iconic status in music, is scheduled to perform that day at Bandra’s Bal Gandharva Rang Mandir Auditorium. </p>
<h2>About <strong>Chick Corea</strong></h2>
<p>The keyboardist, composer and bandleader is a DownBeat Hall of Famer and NEA Jazz Master, as well as the fourth- most nominated artist in Grammy Awards history with 63 nods – and 22 wins! In addition he has a number of Latin Grammys. His repertoire is very diverse. In the late 60s and early 70s he used to play with the legendary Miles Davis Band. In fact, his album “Bitch’s Brew”, where he plays piano with this band, has achieved some sort of a cult status. From straight-ahead jazz to avant-garde sounds, bebop to jazz-rock fusion, children’s songs to chamber and symphonic works, Chick has touched an astonishing number of musical bases in his career.</p>

<p>He has been named Artist of the Year twice this decade in the DownBeat Reader’s Poll. A most creative collaborator, Chick has teamed with artists from jazz legend Lionel Hampton to new-generation pianist Stefano Bollani, from banjoist Béla Fleck to vocal superstar Bobby McFerrin. Chick’s duo partnerships with Gary Burton and Herbie Hancock have endured the test of time. His album “Hot House” earned the pianist two Grammy Awards, his 19th and 20th Grammy wins! Also his album “Trilogy”, with bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade was nominated for two Grammy Awards. He also won a Grammy with John McLaughlin for their live recording of Five Peace Band in 2009. </p>
