<p>Desi Deli at Bandra Reclamation, is one of the latest deli to enter the already spoilt-for-choice Bandra eating-out space. A tiny place with just about 7-8 tables that can take probably 20-22 people at a time, Desi Deli is located bang opposite Salt Water Grill at Bandra Reclamation. Despite the space limitation, they have done up the place with nice bold colours making it look extremely cheerful. And I loved the fresh flower arrangements on every table!</p>
<p>We went there for lunch on Sayurday afternoon. As the name suggests, Desi Deli is just that – a Deli with a Desi touch. So they have west-style Burgers, Hotdogs and Entrees served with Indian spices and sauces. We ordered a Lush Lamb Burg, Anthony – Pork Sausages and the Champ. The Lamb burger was delightful with an extremely juicy lamb cutlet and served with potato fritters that resembled the Bengali jhuri-bhaja. Jayanta loved the Pork Sausage that came wrapped in a deep fried potato coating and a small bowl of salad. I absolutely loved the Mutton Champ which, you guessed it, resembled the Bengali Mutton Champ. Juicy and extremely tasty, my mouth has started watering as I describe the plate. And it came with a Pav, the Indian equivalent of a Dinner Roll!! Very very tasty…take my word!!</p>
<p>Desi Deli seem to have cracked it with the ‘hatke’ food offerings. The only two negatives, according to me, is that their serving size could be somewhat bigger. Not saying they are small, but the one dish that you may order may not be completely filling. Which means, for 2 people, you may have to order 3 dishes. Get the point? For instance, they served the Champ with only one Pav. I had to order another. The other negative is the pricing. For the portions they serve, the rate seemed a tad too high. We paid INR 1250+ for the above meal plus Ice-tea and Sweet Lime.</p>
<p>Baring the portions vs the pricing, we had a pleasant experience. Food is definitely their USP. Their staff is cheerful and extremely helpful. We were pleasantly surprised by their service quality – they gave wet tissues after the meal. Awesome!!</p>
