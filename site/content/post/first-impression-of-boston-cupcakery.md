Perhaps) today afternoon.</p>
<p>The Cupcake shop has almost maintained the Bru layout, but instead of the rustic decor, the decor here is a bit more wooden and contemporary. But it will remind you of Bru cafe which used to be there earlier.</p>
<p>I had the Boston Cream Cupcake (Rs 100) which is the least sweet version. The cupcake was nothing special and if it was only priced at Rs 50/- instead of Rs 100 and would have hit the sweet spot.</p>

They serve waffles and cupcakes shakes and ice cream along with a cup of coffee or some boutique tea items. They even had a Salad section, but my eyes completely missed it, I think.</p>
<p>The service is cocky when I asked about the prices on the menu; the guy said those prices were sample prices; he was not interested in answering my query and had the body language of &#8220;Pay what I tell you to pay&#8221;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To sum it up, its a good place to hangout, if the service doesn&#8217;t piss you off. I don&#8217;t think the cupcakes are that special, but I am hardly the cupcake connoisseur, so I will be waiting for your reviews.</p>
