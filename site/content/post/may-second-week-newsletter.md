<h2 id="my-attempt-to-get-vaccinated_1">My attempt to get Vaccinated</h2>

My sister sent me a Whatsapp informing me to get vaccinated before the rush of 18-44-year-olds starts. I checked the covin website and saw that there were no seats left for my pin code.

I searched district wise and finally managed to get a paid vaccination appointment for May 5 at Bombay Hospital. That day I took an Uber to Bombay Hospital, only to be told by the guard that they would not be doing vaccinations for the last 10 days.

I'm frustrated because not only was I out for half a day for my vaccination appointment, but they didn't bother to text me that the vaccination wasn't happening.

I think there is a lot of confusion between the state and the centre because of their troubled politics and with Mr Adar Poonawala becoming quite touchy about some threats.

> I am waiting for my turn whenever it comes now.

_What has been your experience? Do you know any senior citizens who need help to get their appointments?_

I stumbled across this [excellent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-rvyPGEAeQ&t=25s) by veteran journalist Shekhar Gupta with BMC Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal. The second wave has infected people who are 95% from rich backgrounds, which is the exact opposite of the first wave where 95% of infected people were from slums. This creates problems for BMC as the commissioner says that these rich people are impatient and are trying to get direct results from the testing labs and pressure hospitals to give ICU beds.Watch the interview or read my [brief summary of the interview here](https://blog.urbanwiz.in/notes-from-interview-with-bmc-commissioner-iqbal-singh-chahal/).

One of the things I've decided to do during the lockdown is to write more. I average over 1,000 words a day and some days I write over 3,000 words.

The lockdown is extremely isolating for me, and the only way I am able to reach out is by writing on my numerous blogs. This newsletter is one of my communication tools.

If you are also a writer and think you can create quality content, [here are some guidelines](https://blog.urbanwiz.in/content-guidelines-for-bandra-info-and-powai-info/) on what we like to post on our site.
