<p>Dance Movement Therapy is a celebration of life, with all its ups and downs, in a safe space where we can let it all go and rejoice in it at the same time, through dance and movement. The body and the mind move in tandem, and quite simply, the body through its dance, pulls the mind to move with it, shed a little baggage, and do a little jig. But we often are shy to let ourselves dance. Sometimes we feel that we <i>can&#8217;t</i>, sometimes we feel that we <i>shouldn&#8217;t</i>, sometimes we just <i>feel</i> too much to dance. And that&#8217;s where this session comes in, to very slowly pull us, even with our three left feet &#8211; yes three &#8211; and all our collective luggage, to start tapping till we can&#8217;t stop ourselves from dancing.</p>
<p>To take a little quote from Lee Ann Womack&#8217;s song that seems apt:<i>&#8216;When you have the choice to sit it out or dance, I hope you dance. I hope you dance.&#8217; </i></p>
