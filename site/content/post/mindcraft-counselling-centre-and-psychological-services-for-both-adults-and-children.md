<p>mind Craft is the vision of Dr.Shwetambara Sabharwal, a Clinical Psychologist and Psychotherapist.</p>
<p>We are a counselling centre committed to providing a multitude of psychological services for both adults and children.</p>
<p>Step into the world of mindCraft! Be a craftsman of change, perceiving it as growth and not stress as a victory, not a set back!</p>
<p>We believe that the key to growth is the introduction of higher dimensions of consciousness into our awareness. What makes it challenging is that growth requires change. Most often change is desired yet resisted by us. MindCraft was conceptualized to provide a safe place for change and growth. We hope to ease such transitions, assist in envisioning goals and encourage children and adults in achieving them.</p>
<p>At mindCraft, a team of professional and dedicated psychologists work to provide children and adults the vision, knowledge and skills to deal with stresses life presents us with. Be it your child&#8217;s performance at school,happiness in life, a better relationship with spouse or change in career, our patients&#8217; goals become ours.</p>
<p>mindCraft believes in solution focused and result oriented work and ensures that changes in life are perceived as growth and not stress; as a victory, not a setback.</p>
<p>There are a number of programs at Mindcraft which can benefit you.</p>
