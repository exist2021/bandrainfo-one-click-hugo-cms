Quick . Flexible. Convenient</strong></p>
<p>Wok Express opens its first restaurant in the heart of Bandra on the 15th of May with an easily customized menu.</p>
<p>The cool concept of Wok Express works on three easy steps that stand between you and your meal. You can customize by first choosing your own base (steamed rice, udon/wheat/ramen noodles), then choose your favourite fresh vegetables or meats and lastly the sauces, which range from traditional teriyaki to more adventurous pumpkin curry and sambal, along with condiments.  Each preference is priced accordingly so you can design your meal according to your hunger and budget.</p>

<p>Wok Express plans to add Sushi and Cheong Fun to the food roster in the months to come, making it accessible beyond Asian fine dines. The chain will also offer express home delivery service for orders placed over the phone or ordered online on wokexpress.in with help from their Ninjas.</p>
<p>Psst. Look out for customized fortune cookies that you can wok away with at the end of your meal.</p>
<p>Price for two: Rs 700</p>
<p>Bandra will be the first outlet followed up by the second opening at Lower Parel, shortly.</p>
