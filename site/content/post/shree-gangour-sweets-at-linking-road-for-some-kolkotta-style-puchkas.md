<p>Shree Gangour Sweets has set up shop at Linking road, very close to National College. The Kolkotta Puchka comes highly recommended here, besides that you could try the Allu kabli and Samosa’s.</p>
<h1>Chaat Items</h1>
<p>They have all the regular chaat items like sevpuri, Raj Kachori, chola Batura. For the health conscious they serve multi-grain bread sandwiches and also have a salad counter. There are varieties of doulas like corn and methi doulas for the gujju aficionado in you.</p>
<h2>On the Sweeter Note</h2>
<p>The Paneer Jalebi at Shree Gangour Sweets has been recommended to me by my Instagram Community members. Their Malpua also comes recommended as per some tomato reviews. </p>
<p dir="ltr">They do home deliveries also.</p>
