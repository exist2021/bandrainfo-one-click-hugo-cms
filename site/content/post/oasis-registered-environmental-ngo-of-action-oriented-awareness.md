<p>OASIS is a highly dedicated socially oriented organization, working toward the aim of promoting environmental awareness through the future generation and it stands for environmental awareness of the students, for the students by the students.<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oasis-logo.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-974 alignright" alt="oasis logo" src="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oasis-logo.jpg?resize=300%2C247&#038;ssl=1" width="300" height="247" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oasis-logo.jpg?resize=300%2C247&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oasis-logo.jpg?w=377&amp;ssl=1 377w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>It is with the view of ACTING NOW, that OASIS is on a mission of transformation for a green tomorrow created by children and youth the only and only hopeful segment of our world.</p>
<p>The roots of OASIS go back to May 1993, when a tragedy hit the Powai Lake in Mumbai and 5000 fish died due to over pumping of water by builders. An academician by profession, Dr. Puja Vijay Sukhija set up OASIS NGO in 1997 with the clear objective of spreading environmental awareness coupled with action oriented programs with its prime focus being children and youth.</p>
<p>OASIS achieves this through a host of activities that are designed to walk the talk. In its endeavour to make ecological learning as interesting and as much fun as possible OASIS has devised several activities which students can get involved in. These activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rallies</li>
<li>Tree/pot plantations</li>
<li>Photo Galleries</li>
<li>On stage and other Contests</li>
<li>Eco Friendly Fairs</li>
<li>Eco-edu field trips</li>
<li>Awareness workshops</li>
<li>Eco School Projects</li>
<li>Public performances</li>
</ul>
