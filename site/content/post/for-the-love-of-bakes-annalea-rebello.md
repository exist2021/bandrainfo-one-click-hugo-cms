I love food!! I guess you can call it an obsession of mine which spans right back to my childhood my memory of baking my first cake with my uncle.</p>
<p class="p2">I was fortunate enough to grow up in a home where there were always plenty of good things to eat.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As I grew so did my interest in food. I took to baking and that stayed on. Baking makes me happy and the best part about it is that my family and friends have been very supportive to push me into chasing my dream. From cakes to tarts to cupcakes; I love spending time baking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My ice breaker in most conversations is cakes which ends up in friends and family planning another reunion where cake is the prime request. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Putting up in Bandra allowed me the option to visit some of the finest restaurants and indulge in some of the most salivating pastries which made me decide that baking was my dream and I would love to pursue it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chocolate being my weakness, I love to use it as much as I can in my cakes. </span><span class="s2">‘<i>Want some chocolate with this? Why not!</i>’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It took me a while to realize my dream, to make that shift from looking at gorgeous pictures to making them myself. The whole experience has been life changing for me so far as it has helped me open my mind to so many new ideas and various new techniques. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I would say baking to me comes easy. All you need is a nice bowl, a wooden spatula and passion towards baking!</span></p>
