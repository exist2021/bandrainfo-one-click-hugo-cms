# Chaayos Woes

Due to the recent controversy around White Hat Jr., I have been suspicious about all startups, mainly those led by the IIT and IIM credentials guys. After doing my chores during Lockdown I felt like putting up my legs and ordering on Zomato. Thatâ€™s when I stumbled upon **Chaayos which was offering discounts as much as 30-50 percent**. Seems like a deal but was it worth it?

As unfortunate as one can be, I had an awful experience with them. Right from the insipid and stale teas to their deceptive packaging which I focused on my [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/bandrainfo/status/1358376178671902720?s=20). **Crossing it off my recommendation list for sure.**

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thread - The <a href="https://twitter.com/Chaayos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Chaayos</a> Packaging which claims to keep food Hot for 60 minutes is wishful thing to the least. What bothers me more is that the packaging is deceptive. It hides a hideous looking plastic bag in a brown card box.  . <a href="https://t.co/a2RuDTBKCP">pic.twitter.com/a2RuDTBKCP</a></p>&mdash; Bandra.info (@bandrainfo) <a href="https://twitter.com/bandrainfo/status/1358376178671902720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2021</a></blockquote>

# #JusticeforJhanvi

Jhanvi Kukrejaâ€™s murder on NYE has been mind-boggling. Though her case is not as popular the SSR murder case which the media wholeheartedly focused on. Anyway, to my dismay, I have to say that this gruesome murder of the young 19-year-old Jhanvi, gives us a glimpse of what is happening with the youth. More so the youth residing in Bandra and Khar.

I have been a bit reckless in speculating on the various [hypothesis of the murder](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKkn5nbpe7e/) but my subconscious says that this murder was a [passion crime](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKvJOdOpahb/). So passionate is the crime that it made the person lose their minds.

> Since there is no eye witness to what happened on the staircase, I am sceptical if anything of worth is going to come out of this case.

## Yay! Skateboarding is my new hobby

Thanks to the new skatepark at carter road which is a blessing for skateboarders in Mumbai. As we all know that Mumbai roads are can be quite pathetic and most other parks think skateboarders as a nuisance which is quite sad, frankly. So, what do we local skateboarders do besides going to the one at BKC city park? Though luckily there is a small ramp at Khar Social. If you haven't checked the Cartersâ€™ skateboard park here is a [link](__GHOST_URL__/carter-road-gets-a-skatepark-and-it-is-called-hype-in-the-city/).

> The downside is that the park construction seems a bit shoddy as there are all pebbles disintegrating on the pathway of the Skatboarders.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What kind of shoddy concretely is used the skatepark is all chipping @bombay_sb all pebbles here a guy could have broken his head <a href="https://t.co/ScmZiQTF6A">pic.twitter.com/ScmZiQTF6A</a></p>&mdash; Bandra.info (@bandrainfo) <a href="https://twitter.com/bandrainfo/status/1355040154872758272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 29, 2021</a></blockquote>

I was looking for some outdoor activity of various kinds and I found skateboarding one the most lucrative. I truly enjoy the feeling of being on top of the skateboard, at first it might seem daunting to some as it can be a rough sport. It is about balance, building your core strength, and being graceful. I got a brand new [Piso skateboard](https://pisoskateboards.com) for this main reason and I will be happy to talk to you in-depth about skateboarding if you are interested.

# New brands

The new buzz is about Bade Miya coming and replacing the old CBTL or Trupti Sweets place at linking road.

[Subko](https://www.instagram.com/subkocoffee/) seems to be one of the most popular coffee shops right now-The croissants are delicious but might cost as much as Rs 400 which might not be so pocket friendly. The best part is that they are freshly oven-baked on the same day as they are sold, so you are guaranteed quality and no stale items.

> On the topic of cafÃ©â€™s, there is [Boojee CafÃ©](https://www.instagram.com/boojeecafe/) which I discovered and is a great place to grab a hot cup of coffee. Boojee has some exciting breakfast options too. So, If you order on their website it is cheaper than ordering on Zomato.

For the Vegan-friendly peeps, there is [Earth Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/earthcafewaterfield/) which has carved a niche of itself. Another alternative is Seeds of Life which has a following of its own as people are raving about their thin-crust pizzas, Though there is Farmers Cafe and Sequel too if one must add it to their bucket list.

> Oh, and we shouldnâ€™t forget [Javaphile](https://www.instagram.com/javaphile.in/) which is another noteworthy launch in the coffee shop space, quite a dainty place filled with crowd.

Despite the crumbling infrastructure, entrepreneurial-minded people keep launching brands in Bandra.

# Interviews

I am going slow on the interview series. But I did manage to do two interviews. [Mary Dsouza Sequeira](__GHOST_URL__/interview-with-mary-dsouza-sequiera-indias-first-female-olympian-from-bandra/), the Olympian from Bandra whose daughter has written a book on her and [Sandhya Krishnan,](__GHOST_URL__/sandhya-krishnan-on-dynamicliving/) the former owner of brands like The Shop and Sanctum. Both of them are quite endearing personalities once must check them out!

## Trivia

Do you know the connection between Bandra to Shirdi Sai Baba?
