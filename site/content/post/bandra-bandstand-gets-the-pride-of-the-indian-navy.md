<p>Bandra’s most visited promenade space, Bandstand has a small triangular traffic island of around 3000 sq.ft. area which is now being converted into an open public space with the initiative taken by BMC, Indian Navy, the Municipal Councillor Mr.Asif Zakaria, local residents and Ar. Rinka D’Monte of <a href="http://homeplansindia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atelier ARBO</a>. The inauguration is scheduled to happen on 20th March 2020 followed by a small event organized by Mr Peter D’Souza.</p>
<p>The INS Viraat Memorial will have the Sea Harrier Aircraft, an honour of the Indian Navy, being passed on as its legacy to the BMC (currently decommissioned by INS Viraat.)</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is the first step towards changing the traffic islands in the city, on how they can be perceived and used for good by the local residents, applying the notion of adaptive reuse” &#8211; <strong>Ar. Rinka D’Monte. </strong></p></blockquote>

<h2 id="9p5qb">Bandstand Traffic islands as a planned beautiful gathering place</h2>
<p>In urban centres, parks and plaza’s remain an ideal space for recreation, relaxation and connecting with people. However, apart from these formal gathering spaces, streets and footpaths form the informal precincts to meet and exchange ideas. Similar to the parks, these traffic islands and streets require attention and be planned more sensitively for the public. The traffic islands are abandoned places within the city, which can be planned and articulated beautifully to form a gathering place as well.</p>

<p>The idea is to eradicate the boundary walls, which act as a physical and visual barrier for the people and hence eliminate the separation between the park and the people, making it more accessible for all. The seating’s around the aircraft will be arranged all across the boundary of the park, sea-facing as well as on the other side. A perfect blend of the park’s hardscape and softscape will be seen, forming an attractive live space with a rich diversity of flora. The plane park will not only be a landmark for the people but also be designed more meaningfully to be used for recreation and relaxation by the residents and the visitors.</p>
