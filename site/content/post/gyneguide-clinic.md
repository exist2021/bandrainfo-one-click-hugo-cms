We offer free online consultation &#8211; and quality consultation in various clinics (free consultation on specified days).</p>
<p><strong>Why Gyneguide?</strong></p>
<p>While there are myriads of internet sites offering information about almost every ailment there is, it is important to understand how this information applies to YOU. Because your case is unique and only an experienced gynaecologist can tell you what is good for you, or what chances you have! For example, these are certain questions you may have in your mind, depending on what your gynaecological problem is. The answers to many of these questions would differ from person to person. That is why we give YOU the unique opportunity to get the answers you are seeking!</p>
<p>Sometimes your doctor may not have the time to patiently answer your queries. At Gyneguide, we try to bridge the gap between the doctor and patient so that you can take educated decisions vis-Ã -vis your own health.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because: Privacy is most important! You are ensured of strict confidentiality.</li>
<li>Because: When you are confused, we guide you to help make the right health choice.</li>
