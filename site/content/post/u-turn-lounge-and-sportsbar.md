<p>Perched atop Khar’s famous Evergreen hotel, this swanky rooftop restobar captures the true Wild West flare along with breathtaking views of the suburban skyline. The sweeping space is infused with elements like saddles, horseshoes, bridles and winkers. Head over to this breezy roof deck to watch the sun go down, play a game of chess on our in-house giant board or simply relax in a fun laidback ambiance. After all, meals and mojitos always taste better a few stories above sea level.</p>
