<p><b>Facilities and Equipment: </b></p>
<p>We have a large hall housing regular cardio and strength training equipment that has been specially chosen and designed for rehabilitation purposes and to ensure injury-free exercise for our other clients. We also use Exercise bands, Medicine balls, Free weights, Vestibular balls, balance pads, cuffs, etc.</p>
<p><b>Exercises:</b></p>
<p>Cardiovascular fitness, Strength and Endurance, Flexibility and Posture correction: We give equal importance to all of these while designing programs. Of course, depending on the result of individual assessments, we may concentrate on one aspect of fitness more than others.</p>
<p>We also use a combination of Yoga, Pilates, Functional Training, Balance and Proprioception Training, and several other exercise forms when we design exercises.</p>
<p><b>Cardiac Prehab program:</b></p>
<p>Is a close relative suffering from cardiac related disease (like high BP, heart attack etc)? Having a father, mother, brother or sister in your family with heart disease is a risk factor for you developing a heart problem yourself.</p>
<p>Do you have any other lifestyle related factors that might put you at risk? (e.g Obesity / sedentary lifestyle/ diabetes/ smoking, etc)</p>
<p>What can you do to reduce your risk and prevent a heart attack?</p>
<p>Welcome to our Cardiac Pre-hab program: Our team will take you through a lifestyle and risk factor modification program, which will include diet and exercise prescription specially made for you.</p>
<p><b>Childhood Obesity and nutrition</b></p>
<p>If you see your child with baby fat even after the age of 12 &amp; you find him relatively less active in sports activities, you must start working on his health. Child obesity has become the latest threat to health. Correct nutrition should start very early, &amp; younger the child the better to start.</p>
<p>Our Nutrition section will cater to this problem &amp; will advise on Diet &amp; Exercise for your child.</p>
<p><b>Antenatal Exercises</b></p>
<p>There will be some days in your pregnancy when just getting out of bed can be a challenge so exercise might seem out of the question. But staying active has lots of benefits both during your pregnancy, when it comes to giving birth, and also for a good recovery after birth.</p>
<p>Whether you were a regular at the gym before you got pregnant, or more of a couch potato, we&#8217;ve got tips on how to exercise safely during this joyous period.</p>
<p><b>Knee Replacement PRE-hab program:</b></p>
<p>Patients who are more fit prior to surgery may have shorter hospital stays and a quicker and pleasanter recovery post-operatively. Controlling your weight will help your new knee joint last longer. A weight loss and exercise program started 2-3 months before knee/ hip replacement will give best results.</p>
<p>Try our pain management, exercise and diet programs BEFORE committing to a knee replacement surgery</p>
<p><b>Postural Correction/ Injury PRE vention</b></p>
<p>Your body&#8217;s musculoskeletal system is a finely balanced and tuned machine. It allows you to stand upright, walk, run, jump, play and work. The reason it works so well is because of your spine&#8217;s posture.</p>
<p>Over time a chronically poor posture causes muscular tightness and weakness which can eventually lead to back and joint pains.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can often Correct Posture through Strength Training!</p>
