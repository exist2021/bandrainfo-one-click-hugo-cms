<p><span style="color: #141823;"><strong>&#39;Purple Yellow Red and Blue&#39;</strong> by <em>Portugal. The Man</em></span><span style="color: #141823;"><em> </em>playing on the headphones, Windy scenes from the outside and snacking on my preferred delicately wrapped middle eastern wrap from this tiny eatery which i parceled away on my way back.</span><br style="color: #141823;"><br style="color: #141823;"><span style="color: #141823;">This gem of a eatery is tucked inside a garment shop off Hill Road, Bandra. Layers of chicken rubbed in middle eastern spices on the Rotis</span><span class="text_exposed_show" style="color: #141823;">serie, stacks of Pita and little steel dabbas filled with the wrap ingredients overwhelm this tiny space. </span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show" style="color: #141823;">Gentle &#038; Precise hands of this guy as he carefully grills the pita on each side and in a very calculated way spreads the sauce, arranges the vinaigrette pickles, fries, cabbage and finally the sweetly cut shards of chicken mixed with chopped tomato is all a process that I&#39;ve never missed in all these years as i place my order. Flavour-wise, it is one of the best Shawarma joint across town as it does not involve any additional desi sauces or the altered chicken tikka or tandoori taste that many places with a rotisserie in their possession do nowadays.</span></p>
<p>Though avoid visiting the place during peak hours of Hill road shopping. You may be disappointed as it will take more than 15-20 mins to process your order, solely because these guys never rush. Each wrap is just as carefully prepared as it was the first or last order of the day.</p>
<p>The name of the eatery is &#39;<strong>Marinate</strong>&#39;. You can locate inside a garment shop bang opposite Archies.</p>
