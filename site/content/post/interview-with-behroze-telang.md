I have known Behroze since I started the [@bandrainfo](https://twitter.com/bandrainfo) Twitter account. She is one of the most twitter savvy septuagenarian with a unique handle [@motherr](https://twitter.com/motherr). Unfortunately, I haven't had the pleasure of meeting her yet. But during these lockdown times, it is more advisable to meet online.

> After a bit of persuasion, Behroze has given this "to the point" twitter DM interview.

## You are a Dadar girl, when did you become a Bandra girl?

After marriage years & years ago (I think 1972). First Santacruz then Khar/ Bandra.

## You are quite active on Twitter? Not many senior citizens are on Twitter? What keeps you hooked to Twitter?

I am quite active on Twitter to point out issues of bad roads, footpaths etc. Now in the pandemic more so to cheer me up & get cheered up. Met a few interesting people. No politics no religion.

## Tell us something about your work before you retired?

I worked for an airline & a hotel for many years. So quite familiar with airline/ hotel management.

## How has Bandra changed for you?

Bandra has changed a lot. The sleepy bungalows of Khar now become hi-rise buildings. Suddenly became a Bollywood space as residents started selling their bungalows. Now every lane has a celebrity living & become a hifi area.

I love Bandra with its swanky eateries, shopping places& hifi restaurants but now too crowded. Obviously with small shady lanes now having swanky hifi buildings.

## What do you think Bandra could do better at?

Too many hawkers, too many bad driving riks going into no-entry lanes. Footpaths can be levelled. Otherwise, a crowded but safe place to live in. Carters & joggers is a lovely place to spend evenings on sr citizens.

## Last question - Your favourite food place, hang out and shop?

Love china garden, Yoko's & Candies. Shopping at shoppers Stop or Elco for more affordable stuff. I used to visit carters with my school friend every Sunday. Now havenâ€™t for months.
