<p>The Vintage Garden is about talented individuals showcasing their works via various art forms such as art &amp; crafts, fashion, architecture, product design, music, film &amp; photography in the 1800 square feet courtyard behind the Patkars’ house (as well as two indoor rooms) as a space to promote design and creativity.</p>
<p>A platform that is organic in its essence, giving artists of all kinds a space that encourages their creative vision.</p>
<p>The Vintage Garden is set in the rear courtyard of a 1920&#8217;s colonial style home that belongs to the Patkar Family.</p>

<p>Aarti Patkar&#8217;s desire for art, beauty, and style stems from her home, and her interest in all things antique, vintage &amp; modern.</p>
<p>With a desire to recreate Chor Bazaar at the Patkar House with actual vendors from the market to film screenings, the Vintage Garden is sure to be the venue for interesting events.</p>
<p>Walk in, brush your hands over beautiful things &amp; relish the gentle sunlight that spills through the trees.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Vintage Garden. Take your time.</p>
