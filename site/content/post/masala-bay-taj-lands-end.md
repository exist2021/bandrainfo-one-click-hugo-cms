<p>Savour the new wave of contemporary Indian cuisine over a glass of wine. Blending aromatic Indian spices with modern cooking techniques, Masala Bay produces flavours that add a new dimension to the experience of dining. With a selection of traditional Indian favourites cooked in minimal oil and with just the right blend of spices, the restaurant shows that light and flavourful are not culinary opposites. The extensive cuisine spread features traditional Indian food with an accent on seafood from coastal regions of India.</p>
<p>Masala Bay features an interactive theatre kitchen, a separate bar area and three private dining rooms. A harmonious composition of forms varying in texture, material and colour, the interiors of the restaurant are enhanced by the pleasing use of light and contrast that creates a sense of intimacy in the open, large space. Warm silver tones and occasional flashes of colour along with polished granite floors, lend a clean and contemporary look. The dramatic d√©cor is the perfect setting for the progressive cuisine.</p>
<p>Complement your meal with a selection from the The Lounge Bar. You can choose from spirits from around the world including a variety of over 500 different wines, ranging from New World vintages to all time favourite like French Bordeaux.</p>
