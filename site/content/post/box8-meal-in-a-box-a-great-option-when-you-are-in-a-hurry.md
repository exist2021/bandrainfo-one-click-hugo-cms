<p><a href="https://box8.in/">Box8.in</a> is a home delivery option for people who need a quick meal while working and in a hurry. The meals are cheap and better than your average cafeteria food.</p>
<p>I ordered a paneer makhanwala + paratha + gajjar halwa which was delivered in 30 mins to my door. You can also order online on box8.in. Their physical branch is situated at Palinaka where you can pick up a meal and they even have a android and iOS app.</p>
<p>They have recently interested some international meals which gives you a option between Mexican/Italian.</p>
