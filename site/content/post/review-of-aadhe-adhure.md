<p dir="auto">By Manju Sampat</p>
<p>Aadhe Adhure, is a powerful play, written by Mohan Rakesh, that deals with a dysfunctional family who seem to be caught in a web of unhappy circumstances and relationships. Savitri (Komal Chhabria), is a middle aged woman living with her spineless husband Mahindra (Ashok Pandey),  and her three children. Ashok (Uddhav Vij) is the eldest and is a good  for nothing, unemployed wastrel. Then comes Binni (Saadhika Syal) who  eloped with Manoj, but is back home as her her marriage does not seem to  be working out. Her husband accuses Binni of carrying unnecessary  â€˜emotional baggage from her maternal home. Lastly there is the teenaged  Kinni, (Urvazi Kotwal) who is head strong and rude to everyone in the  family.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Savitri is totally frustrated with her lot, especially with Mahindra,  who has failed to provide her with any emotional or financial security.  She feels totally let down by her husband and she sees him as a weakling  who is being taken advantage of by his friend Juneja. So it is Savitri  who has to support the family by working in an office. Mahindra is  equally frustrated and thinks he is treated like a â€˜rubber stampâ€&#x2122; at  home, and feels most sorry for himself.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Savitriâ€&#x2122;s boss, Singhania comes visiting and she hopes that he can use  his contacts to get her good for nothing son, a job. Ashok is totally  contemptuous of Singhania and his raucous laugh and disgusting habit of  scratching himself. Ashok Pandey is excellent as the uncultured  Singhania. In fact Pandey plays five roles most convincingly, including  the role of Juneja, who Savitri is most resentful of, as she is  convinced he cheated her husband in their financial dealings<br />
.<br />
Everyone seems to be getting on each others nerves and this tension and  claustrophobic atmosphere pervades to the audience as well. Finally  Savitri can&#8217;t take it any more. She decides to leave her family and go  away with an ex flame, Jagmohan, another role played by Ashok Pandey!  Incidentally Pandey is also the director of this play, as well as the  faceless</p>

<p dir="ltr">Everyman’s sutradhar, symbolic of how many people are caught in  similar unfulfilling relationship webs. Pandey does indeed wear many  hats!<br />
The play is tautly written, and the language used by the playwright is  hard hitting and searing. The constant tension amongst the characters on  stage makes this a dramatically powerful watch. Komal Chhabria gets  under the skin of the protagonist Savitri, and gives a brilliant  performance. She is emotive, expressive and totally convincing as  Savitri. One can feel her pain and frustration. Ashok Pandey manages to  play each of his five roles differently though as Mahindra he tended to  mumble a lot and was barely audible at times. However, that might have  been on purpose as he meant to share his secret frustrations with the  audience without his wife listening! The three children also lend able  support, and the influence of the Goldberg studios form of Method  Acting on them, is very obvious. In the end, Savitri returns to her  family as her foray with Jagmohan does not seem to have worked out, all  men are the same, she feels. So she is back to where she started and  the play has come a full circle.</p>
