<p>Innovative, vibrant and creative, Kangaroo Kids is a result of Ms. Lina Ashar’s passion to make every learning moment joyful, effective and meaningful.When Lina returned from Melbourne in 1993 with a Bachelor’s degree in Education, it did not take her long to understand the limitations of the existing education system in India.</p>
<p>Her conviction in the need for change led to the establishment of her first preschool in Bandra (Mumbai) in 1993, with only 13 students.</p>
<p>Today, Kangaroo Kids Education Ltd. has blossomed into a renowned educational group with over 80 schools across different cities in India as well as in Dubai and Maldives.</p>
<p>Kangaroo Kids provides an engaging curriculum and state-of –the art equipment in a safe and stress-free environment and imparts holistic education to the children.</p>
<p><strong>Kangaroo Kids Club &#8211; Giving your toddler a head start</strong></p>
<p>The Kangaroo Kids Club creates an action-based learning in a fun-filled environment, and is among the first in the country to offer a mother-toddler interactive programme.</p>
<p>This programme is divided into two levels:</p>
<p><b>The Toddler Programme</b></p>
<p><strong>The Toddler Programme (Toddler and Significant care-giver) &#8211; For Children aged between 10 months and 1 year and 5 months</strong></p>
<p>The Mother-Toddler Programme is an interactive programme that helps children develop some vital skills like colour identification, mathematical concepts, sorting, forming of sets, sequencing, eye-hand co-ordination, language, vocabulary and concentration. For this programme, the child has to be accompanied by the mother thrice a week.</p>
<p><b>The Toddler Transitional Programme</b></p>
<p><b>The Toddler Transitional Programme &#8211; For Children aged between 1 year 6months and 1.11 yrs</b></p>
<p>When a child is around one and a half years old, he/she can perform several activities with minimum assistance. Therefore, this programme is little more challenging, with 1 hour 30 minute sessions for five days a week. For this programme too, the child can be accompanied by the mother/significant care-giver.</p>
<p><b>Kangaroo Kids Preschool &#8211; 1.6 yrs</b></p>
<p>In the preschool, the skills acquired in the earlier years are enhanced. Kangaroo Kids preschool aims at making the child independent while building a social, emotional and academic base. The curriculum not only covers language, maths and science, but also includes several important skills that are essential building blocks for further learning. A variety of activities and field trips keeps the interest levels of the children high, so that they perceive learning as a joyful experience and thus, are much better prepared to enter the mainstream school.</p>
<p>The facilities provided in the preschools include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slides and see-saws</li>
<li>Flower bed</li>
<li>Doll-house</li>
<li>Inflated pool</li>
