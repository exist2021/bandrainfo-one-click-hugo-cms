<p>We all lead life which more or less conforms to the expectations the society has from us. But what about people who stand out and pursue what their heart tells them and not what society expects them.</p>
<p>It is said, Meditation is the single minded pursuit of what your heart desires. Here is a interesting interview i stumbled on Youtube with the Firoze Shakir Sufi Beggar Poet <em>( He is not a beggar, he runs a tailoring shop in bandra, in his humilty he identifies himself with the most commonest of the humans. This is the compassion of Firoze Shakir &#8220;The Beggar Poet&#8221;.)</em><br />
