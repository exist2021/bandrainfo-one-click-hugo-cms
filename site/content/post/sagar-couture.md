<p>SAGARCOUTURE is a designer apparel store in Mumbai that provides its clients with timeless elegance and sophistication via a luxurious retail experience.</p>
<p>Dealing exclusively in Indian fashion, Sagar’s first store in Bandra was founded in 1963.</p>
<p>The fabrics stocked at that time mainly comprised of cottons and printed cottons. Sagar was one of the pioneers of unstitched cotton suits in the 1980’s. The exploration of new fabrics such as crepe, chiffon and georgette began at about the same time. Sagar Sarees was also launched later during the same period. Satya Paul’s printed fabrics and sarees are also sold in the store since the mid 90s.</p>
<p>The year 2004 witnessed the launch of SAGARCOUTURE, the designer wear section of Sagar. With a variety of labels showcasing the choicest offerings on display, SAGARCOUTURE has secured a firm base with its clientèle. Some of our patrons amongst the crème de la crème in Mumbai are the Hindujas, the Thackerays, the Ruias, Sushmita Sen, Kirron Kher, Sridevi, Aishwarya Rai, Gauri Khan, NeetuKapoor and many others.</p>
<p>Amongst the many couturiers who stock with Sagar Couture, Rohit Bal and Manish Arora were the first.</p>
<p>SAGARCOUTURE envisions the spirit of each Indian woman to be dynamic and spectacular. Balancing multiple and diverse roles in her hands, she successfully amalgamates them into one perfect entity establishing herself as nothing but a goddess, with a touch of glamour and allure that complement her true brilliance.</p>
