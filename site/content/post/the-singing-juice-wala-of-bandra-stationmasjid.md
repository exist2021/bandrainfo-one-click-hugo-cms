<p dir="ltr">To the left of Bandra Masjid on the west side there is  A1 zam zam singing juice centre. The juice center has an interesting marketing strategy to sell their juices, milkshakes.They sing improvised Bollywood songs which sound fun but you can hardly make any sense of it. </p>

<blockquote><p>The singer is Jamshed Siddiqui, a native of Solapur in Maharashtra, who has spent most of his life in Mumbai. &#8220;There are usually two others with me; they are back in the village for their holidays right now,&#8221; says Jamshed.<br /><cite> &#8211; via <a href="https://www.mid-day.com/articles/folk-song-session-free-with-juice-at-bandra-stall/63504">www.mid-day.com</a></cite></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>While a chubby Jamshed croons, a bright-eyed Wasim Khan thrusts &#8220;Cocktail&#8221; into your hands. &#8220;It&#8217;s called such because it&#8217;s a mix of everything&nbsp;&#8212; the juice of apple, pineapple, mango, mosambi and milk. It&#8217;s the first thing you should try,&#8221; he says with an angular hand movement. Three colleagues nod as they rush to thrust more glasses of &#8220;Cocktail&#8221; into other passersby&#8217;s hands.<br /><cite> &#8211; via <a href="https://www.mid-day.com/articles/folk-song-session-free-with-juice-at-bandra-stall/63504">www.mid-day.com</a></cite></p></blockquote>
