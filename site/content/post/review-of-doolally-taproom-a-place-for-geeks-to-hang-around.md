<p>Having heard a lot from people who travel to Pune about this doollaly microbrewery. After much ado they finally opened up at ONGC colony at Bandra reclamation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fairly spacious, brightly lit up place with a very young crowd, most who seem to be from twitter, if you want a tweetup anytime, just head over to this place. I met @Netra @Arpiit and @Shibanigharat here. What a wonderful thing isn&#8217;t it, otherwise you hardly meet online people in real life.</p>
<p>Now coming to the beer, i tried the apple cider Â and the hefe wizen brew all priced at Rs 250/pint. I am not much of a connoisseur, but its definitely better than the pissed up beers like King fisher and Tuborg. But then I am right now hooked to the German beer Erdinger Dunkel. I didn&#8217;t find the same body to the beer and found the beer a bit harsh while gulping down. But still its a welcome change.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t order much food, as this was a working pub up. But the BBB Bombay duck fried in beer batter and served with thecha (green chilli dip) was a bit too oily. I would have preferred it a bit crisper like the Gajalee variety.</p>
<p>Anyway, being a weekday (Monday) its almost 100% capacity, don&#8217;t even think about coming here on weekends, if you don&#8217;t mind just standing around. But i guess, this place has given a reason for geeks to hang around in bandra.</p>
<p>MUSIC &#8211; Carry your ear phones and playlist.</p>
