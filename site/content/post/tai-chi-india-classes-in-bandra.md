<p>T&#8217;ai Chi is based on principles derived from ancient Chinese philosophical texts such as the I Ching and Tao Te Ching.</p>
<p>These principles help you to focus on the internal aspects. You have to recognize the internal before you begin to venture into the realms of energy and spirit. If you tap into the principles properly, you discover the stillness in the movement and, in turn, the energy that flows through your spirit.</p>
<p><b>Regular practice of T&#8217;ai Chi:        </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Strengthens and stimulates every muscle, joint, organ, gland and tissue of your body</li>
<li>Encourages chi to flow through the acupuncture meridians of the body and dissolves energy blockages</li>
<li>Heals chronic health problems and joint and back injuries</li>
<li>Raises energy level and improves circulation</li>
<li>Relieves stress, even deep unconscious stress that often goes undetected</li>
<li>Reverses many symptoms associated with the &#8220;normal&#8221; process of ageing</li>
<li>Strengthens the immune system</li>
<li>Stabilizes blood pressure</li>
<li>Twists and turns, the basic requirement of every T&#8217;ai Chi movement, help to digest food</li>
<li>Restores youthful flexibility and stamina</li>
<li>Makes you stronger, healthier and more vibrant with the passing years</li>
<li>Eliminates internal weakness, the root cause of all disease</li>
<li>Confers greater sexual endurance</li>
</ul>
<p><b>T&#8217;ai Chi for Corporate Stress Management </b></p>
<p>T’ai Chi is an ideal antidote to modern day stress. T&#8217;ai Chi&#8217;s principles of balance and focus fit in perfectly into the corporate scenario. At present, Tai Chi is fast becoming universally recognized as a high-level system of health that can benefit people of all ages. In addition to health and healing, T’ai Chi also encompasses philosophy, spirituality and self-defence. Recognized in China for centuries as a “fountain of youth”, T’ai Chi has a calming effect on the mind and nerves. The slow, gentle movements are aesthetically appealing and are reminiscent of dance steps.</p>
<p>Learn to relieve stress and restore depleted energy with Seven Simple Exercises based on this internal martial art. In these two- or three-day workshops, each consisting of three hours, you will discover how to improve your balance and flexibility, combat fatigue, tap into your energy, breathe mindfully and meditate and enhance your sense of peace and well-being. The workshop includes a special T&#8217;ai Chi Spinal Stretch that systematically unlocks spinal tension, restores youthful pliability, and eliminates back pain permanently.</p>
<p>These exercises do not require any special place, clothing, equipment, or time. They are gentle and easy enough for anyone to learn, regardless of age or physical ability. Along with the workshop, we also provide instructional DVDs which serve as a reminder system.</p>
