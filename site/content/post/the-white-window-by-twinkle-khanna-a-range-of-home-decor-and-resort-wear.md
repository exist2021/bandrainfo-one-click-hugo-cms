<p>The White Window by Twinkle Khanna introduces their Holiday line: &#8220;Villa Tara &#8221; a range of home décor and resort wear.</p>
<p>The holiday line was named &#8221; Villa Tara&#8221; after Twinkle&#8217;s azure blue old Portuguese villa in Goa where ideas for the collection were envisioned.</p>
<p>Villa Tara at The White Window offers a fabulous range of clothes for cruise wear but home décor is still the highlight. &#8221; Its about translating your aesthetic to every little thing that invades your lifestyle from your hairclips to your vanity case to your holiday beachwear , flip flops and to the way you dine, your home linen, basically what you choose to surround yourself with, &#8220;says Twinkle .</p>
<p>White lace curtains caress long glass windows, carved brass leaves are shaped into the store&#8217;s name, and fancy stone pots at the entrance. That&#8217;s The White Window, the two-month-old home decor store at Ashoka Shopping Centre near Metro cinema. Perhaps the only bright spot in the otherwise staid and crowded landscape of the market.</p>
<p>The White Window is the combined effort of actress, Twinkle Khanna who has a passion for designing interiors, and Gurlein Manchanda, a professional interior designer. Spread over 3,000 sq ft, the interior supports a chic, clear, all white look. The textured walls enhance the wooden structures in the store, while a wooden staircase winds around a fish tank extending 25 feet from the ground to the first floor.</p>
<p>Twinkle explains the purpose behind opening the store. [quote]Gurlein and I have been doing interiors for the last two and a half years. While working on our projects, we could never find simple accessories like lamp fittings and candle stands of our choice. They were either too gaudy or too dull. That&#8217;s when we decided to start a store which would stock extraordinary, practical, and elegant home accessories.[/quote]</p>
<p>And sure enough, The White Window houses a delectable array. From The White Window line which has trendy stuff designed by Twinkle and Gurlein including sofa sets, beds, tables, trays, curtains etc to paintings by Anjolie Ela Menon and Yusuf Arrakal. Besides there is glassware by Manna Glass, beer glasses, champagne flutes and exquisite vases from Ritzenhoff, Michael Aram&#8217;s designer metalware and candles from Dimple Kapadia&#8217;s collection, The Faraway Tree. And then the duo also design home interiors.</p>
<p>The decision to open a store this side of town, says Twinkle, who lives faraway in the suburbs was because that&#8217;s where her partner owned the shop. [quote]But after conducting business for two months, we realised that furniture lines are more popular here than in the suburbs as people are more inclined to opt for designer stuff. We are also planning to open a store in the suburbs in the near future, but that will be mostly accessories,[/quote]  she explains.</p>
<p>Ask her about the response to The White Window and Twinkle beams, &#8220;Overwhelming! We have a regular flow of customers. I think it&#8217;s because there&#8217;s something for everyone. We have people walking out with a designer coffee mug, and others with a sofa set. At the most affordable prices!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her celebrity status must be a definite plus point in her business venture? [quote]As an interior designer, no. Expectations are high when you are a known personality and I have to work doubly hard to gain credibility. Where our store is concerned, The White Window was being written about even before we opened![/quote] &#8221;</p>
