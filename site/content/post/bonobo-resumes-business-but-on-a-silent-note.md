<p>Five months after it was vandalised and forced to down shutters for allegedly trivialising rape, Bandra&#8217;s Bonobo resumed business on Tuesday evening. However, live music, a trademark of the Linking Road hangout joint, was missing.</p>
<p>A staffer from the pub told Mirror that while they had an official opening on Monday, the pub was back in business for patrons on Tuesday.<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bonobo.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-864 alignright" alt="bonobo" src="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bonobo.jpg?resize=300%2C199&#038;ssl=1" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bonobo.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bonobo.jpg?w=594&amp;ssl=1 594w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>[quote]There will be no live music or any DJ for the next one month. We will start with a bang from July. Till such time one can enjoy our food, and cocktails served in the bar,[/quote]  said a staffer.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Mirror had reported that the restaurant management had met Excise Minister Ganesh Naik, requesting him to let them reopen the bar. The minister had agreed to give them permission only on the condition that they signed an affidavit, promising not to repeat the mistake in future.</p>
<p>In January, a group of women workers of a political party vandalised the joint, protesting a cocktail on its menu called &#8216;<strong>Balaatkaar</strong>&#8216;. The protesters alleged that the management was casual towards rape and had demanded that the owners be arrested.</p>
<p>Soon after the incident, the matter was brought to the notice of suburban Collector Sanjay Deshmukh, who decided to suspend the pub&#8217;s liquor licence.</p>
<p>Bonobo&#8217;s management had put up a board after that stating it was closed for renovation.</p>
