<p>Nyassa has its origin in a Sanskrit word that means healing through touch by chanting tantras and mantras. The result. A divine body.</p>
<p>But Nyassa is also a dream, our dream, born out of our passion for making natural bath and body products.</p>
<p>Ishween Anand, the visionary behind Nyassa, left her cushy finance job in New York to pursue her passion for fragrances in India. She first started selling luxurious bath and body products on weekends at the Atria Mall in Mumbai in April 2007. Her vision was to create a beautiful product that was mild on the skin and left a wonderful lingering fragrance.</p>
<p>It is with this philosophy that Nyassa embarked upon creating aesthetic products in rich textures and sensuous aromas. But for your skin to maintain its youthful vitality, the product also has to work harmoniously with it. And that&#8217;s why we only use the finest ingredients, keeping them wholesome, pure and natural to the extent possible. Our processes have been learnt from many experts from around the world. The final product is a work of art. Tantalizingly fragrant. Gloriously beautiful. And gentle on the skin.</p>
<p>Nyassa&#8217;s expertise lies in evoking feelings through fragrances.</p>
<p>Reach out to all these special moments. Only with Nyassa.</p>
<p>Nyassa&#8217;s mission is to create beautiful and fragrant products that infuse divinity and pleasure into the mundane and ordinary rituals of life.</p>
