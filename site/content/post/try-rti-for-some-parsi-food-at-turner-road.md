<p>There are a couple of places in Bandra where you can try some Parsi food. One of them is snack shack at  pali naka and the other by is the RTI ((Ratan Tata Institute) canteen at Parsi Colony at Turner Road. I am not a fan of snack shack as I have found the place not organised and amateurish.</p>
<blockquote><p>RTI is known for its food more than anything else. The catering department prepares the daily menu of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food served at the eight outlets all over the city. They have tiffin services, run a couple of school canteens and make a lot of authentic Parsi bhonu. <br /><cite> &#8211; via <a href="https://bombayparsipunchayet.com/readcontent.aspx?contentid=45&amp;categoryid=29">bombayparsipunchayet.com</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<p>At the RTI  outlet you can pick up some snacks like mutton, chicken cutlets, sandwiches, quiche chicken puff etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Patrel and dalni poori are well known specialties. During the winter you can get Vasanu, which I haven&#8217;t tried yet, but plan too indulge.  For deserts there is some excellent strawberry cream eclairs, tarts and my favourite lagan nu custard. All this comes at a reasonable rates.</p>
