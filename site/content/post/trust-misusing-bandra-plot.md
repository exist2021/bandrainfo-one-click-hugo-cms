<p>In a letter to additional municipal commissioner Aseem Gupta, corporator Asif Zakaria alleged that the plot, situated on the rear side of Rao Saheb Patwardhan Udyan and next to the Bal Gandharva Rang Mandir, was allotted to a private foundation on July 29, 1994 for renovation, beautification and maintenance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The plot has been locked since the past 20 years and is being misused to store construction material. Nothing has been done to maintain, renovate or beautify the plot. Also, no sign has been put up to show the place belongs to the corporation neither is anybody allowed to use the ground to play,&#8221; said Zakaria. -Linah Baliga</p>
<p>Zakaria stated it was shocking that the H(west) ward office was not even aware of the status of the ground nor did it have any records of the same. He said it was only after persuasion that the allotment letter was given to the Ward by the private foundation. &#8220;One the one hand there are various demands by local residents that there are no open spaces available for children to play in the space crunched city of Mumbai and on the other such vast open spaces of the BMC are being misused,&#8221;said Zakaria.</p>
<p>Zakaria has demanded that the BMC take over the plot and develop it for locals to use and play.</p>
