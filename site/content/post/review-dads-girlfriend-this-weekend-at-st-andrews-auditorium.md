<p dir="auto"><strong>Review by Manju Sampat </strong></p>
<p>One of Delhi’s leading theatre groups, The Films and Theatre Society, <br />together with Coconut Theatre, launched their new play  “Dads <br />Girlfriend” this weekend at St. Andrews Auditorium in Bandra.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_8614_full-1.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_8614-1.jpg?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1" align="middle" width="640" height="427" class="aligncenter" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Atul Satya Koushik who is known for his other successful plays like  Chakravyuh featuring Nitish Bharadwaj, Draupadi, featuring Rakesh Bedi  and Himani Shivpuri, Raavan Ki Ramayan, that was also recently performed  in Mumbai, featuring Puneet Issar, now gives us something totally  different. He has written and directed this hilarious play which is an  urban family entertainer in Hinglish. After many successful shows in  Delhi, this theatrical extravaganza “Dad’s Girlfriend” comes to  Mumbai.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Dads Girlfriend” is the story of Mr. Vaidya, a famous and reputed  author, speaker and professor, who in his quest for success, could never  quite devote himself fully to his wife or daughter. He comes from the  U.S. to visit his daughter Diya, who is married to Kanav, a struggling  theatre artist, a profession Vaidya disapproves of. Suman Vaidya is  perfectly cast as the middle aged Vaidya and very ably plays his role.  Apart from this father-daughter bonding, there is Kanav entertaining us  with his witty punches and clever one liners! Satyendra Malik is spot on  as Kanav, and keeps the audience entertained right through the play.  Karishma Singh as Diya is also very convincing. Things get a bit out of  hand and take a rather awkward and funny turn when Avni, an old student  and an ardent fan of Vaidya’s, happens to run into him and starts seeing  him quite often, and in fact she moves in with his family! Anumeha Jain  does a fine job as Avni. She is also a writer and wants Vaidya to get  her book published. Though much younger than Vaidya she falls in love  with him, as she wants a “man not a boy”. Diya too is desperate for her  father’s affection and time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the end, Vaidya finds himself standing at crossroads, needing to make  a choice between his newfound fatherhood and closeness to his daughter  Diya, and the elusive love he was always seeking. This delightful play  is indeed a funny tale of lost and found relationships and life and  laughter. Atul Satya Koushik, the writer and director of this play,  says, “After doing historical and mythological plays, I always wanted to  do something modern and comical. Two years ago I got an idea to work on  human relations, and I’m glad it turned out so well and is receiving so  much love wherever we perform it.”</p>
<p>The sets by Gulfam Mohammed and his team, are excellent and extremely  functional. The costumes and lighting effects are also really good. Do  see this play, as there is an additional show at the Royal Opera House.</p>
