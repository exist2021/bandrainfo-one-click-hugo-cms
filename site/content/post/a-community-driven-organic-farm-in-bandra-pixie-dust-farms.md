<p dir="ltr">I met Christopher Pereira towards the end of monsoon to talk to him about this community is driven project at St. Peters KG. I saw a few tweets from <a href="httpss://twitter.com/diipti" target="_blank">@diipti</a> talking about this farm and how volunteers go and nurture this organic farm. </p>
<p>So enjoy this exclusive interview with Christopher Pereira, and you can meet him on Saturday at the farm and help with the organic farming. You could easily learn a few tricks at the farm and start your little composting setup in your hood and spread the ethos of biological agriculture.</p>
