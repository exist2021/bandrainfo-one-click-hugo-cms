+++


<p>Every year, there is a rush to buy the &#8220;most beautiful Ganesh idols&#8221;, that incidentally are made of Plaster of Paris. Therefore, these idols, when immersed (during the <em>visarjan</em>) do not decompose properly. Hence, the next day, there are many broken idols that get washed onto the shores of various beaches, lakes, and ponds. Since I’m part of The Children’s Movement for Civic Awareness, which has been included in the curriculum for the 8th Standard, I urge you to bring home these Eco-Friendly Ganesh idols that don’t harm the environment and look good too.</p>
