<p>This musical with its intricate presentation of the history and culture of India is really a most absorbing show. From the kings and their kingdoms, to the land and its invaders, from its European influences to its authentically deep rooted culture, from the story of Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi, to Shaheed Bhagat Singh and Mangal Pandey, from Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Subash Chandra Bose, and finally to our independence, the audience is led through this entire sweep of our nation’s history in a most unique and entertaining manner.This is followed by showcasing our culture and presenting it through dance. The North is presented through colourful Punjabi costumes and the ensemble on stage doing some vigorous Bhangra dancing, followed by the South, portraying authentic Kathakali and Bharatnatyam dancing as well as some scintillating Kalaripayattu movements, then followed a brilliant tableaux from the East, highlighting the Durga Puja festival, through Chau dancing as well as Mohiniattam. Lastly the West of our country, showed us their dancing prowess through some superb Garba dancing during Navratri.However, what sets the show apart is that along with all the fun and entertainment, it also gives us a message, as its climax makes, the audience ponder over the real meaning of “freedom “. Since forces of religious intolerance and facism have lead to many instances of terrorism that have touched our daily lives, we need to value our independence and protect it. The Sutradhar did not speak about Mahatma Gandhi till this point, but the play culminates in lauding and venerating this larger than life personality, who “taught us to fight without a fight”! Further shows are planned so please look out for them on BookMyShow.</p>
