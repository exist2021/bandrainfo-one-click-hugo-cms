<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_">If you have been dreaming of a candlelight dinner aboard a floatel in this coastal city, get ready, for in a fortnight&#8217;s time you will see one such anchored near Bandra-Worli Sealink, amidst the breathtaking view of the sea. Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) has signed a memo of understanding (MOU) with a private company to commence the facility at Bandra reclamation sea shore towards Mahim end out of Maharashtra Maritime Board jetty.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_">Says Paraag Jaiin Nainuttia, managing director, MTDC: &#8220;There were some technical issues pertaining to commencement of floating restaurant, which are now cleared. All permissions from every department are in place and sea level is cleared with all formalities concerned. Preparations are on for its inaugural, which we expect to be in a fortnight&#8217;s time.&#8221;</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_">The <a href="https://www.dnaindia.com/topic/floating-restaurant">f</a>loating restaurant has exclusive facilities of three-tiers. There would be an open-to-sky deck with a few galleys and two multi-cuisine restaurants, also a round-the-clock coffee shop and club lounge. It can cater to around 650 to 700 guests at a time. &#8220;The floatel would also enhance the image of Mumbai,&#8221; says Jaiin.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_">Many used to organise Christmas, new year parties at Gateway of India seashore, which were very popular amongst affluent Mumbaikars. These parties were however discontinued by the police after 26/11 attacks, when 10 Pakistani terrorists who reached the city through the sea, unleashed an attack that killed hundreds of people. Floating restaurant is expected to attract more local and foreign tourists to the city.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_">Though Maharashtra is one of the most progressive states in the country, it is way behind other states when it comes to floatels. &#8216;Flor do mar&#8217; floating restaurant in Goa, Kerala Tourism Development Corporation run floating restaurants, Puducherry tourism corporation&#8217;s in Karaikal, Bihar&#8217;s &#8216;Ganga vihar&#8217; in the river ganga, Karnataka&#8217;s cruise n dine&#8217;, Tamil Nadu&#8217;s aquana in Chennai backwaters are a few to name in India.</p>

<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_">&#8220;It is an excellent idea for Mumbai, which attracts tourists from India and across the globe. The floating restaurant would be an added attraction,&#8221; said Nowzer Dudhmal, deputy general manager, Taj Lands End hotel.</p>
<p class=" _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_">According to Mahender Singh Churiana, global tourism expert, &#8220;Mumbai is one of the most sought-after tourist destinations for foreigners but a floating restaurant was long overdue. It&#8217;s better late than never.&#8221; However, the cleanliness and hygiene of the surrounding areas must be maintained; otherwise people will not visit the place, he added.</p>
