Skilled craftsmen were invited to settle here and were ensured a secure livelihood. In the Jaipur tradition, Anokhi tries to maintain an open and honest relationship with its craftspersons. It helps them to work in conditions of their own choosing and commits itself to providing them with sustained work.</p>
<p>The hand block is carved out of wood and is the simplest of printing devices. Dyeing with vegetable colours is the oldest of colouring techniques. As pioneers of hand block printing for the export market, Anokhi has built on these for the last thirty years. It constantly seeks to create an environment in which traditional textiles have their place and value and to build a symbiotic relationship between the market and the design product &#8211; between skill and tradition.</p>
<p>Anokhi&#8217;s designs blend contemporary sensibilities with traditions of excellence. Its designers seek the bold and the striking, the graphic and the colourful, using modern printing techniques to keep pace with a demanding and fast moving world market, keeping the spirit of resurgence always alive.</p>
<p>For many years, Anokhi has also been developing products in specialised areas such as appliqué, embroidery, patchwork and bead work, which now constitute a significant part of its product range. Together with garments &#8211; Indian and Western in design &#8211; home textiles, sarongs and accessories, Anokhi offers a diverse and colourful selection of products.</p>

<p>Anokhi has a state of the art work unit, with more than 200 sewing machines, dry cleaning plants, and checking and packaging units. The company deals with more than ten different printing units and two dyeing units which have largely hereditary practitioners of their respective craft.</p>
<p>Anokhi is distinguished by its prints and sense of designs, range of colours and product quality</p>
<p>For over 40 years, Anokhi’s ideals have been those of conservation and development, through the input of design, marketing and project funding. The Company is well known as an alternative role model for good business practices, and the ongoing revival of traditional textile skills.</p>
