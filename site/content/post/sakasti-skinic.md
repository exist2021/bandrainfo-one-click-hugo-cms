<p><b>High Standards of Hygiene</b></p>
<p>To us at Sakasti, skin-care is a hygiene exercise, a clean-up of the skin drive and maintenance of it thereafter. And if this does not demand the best of hygiene standards, what will? This demand has propelled us to evolve and maintain a hygiene standard all our own. A standard we call ‘Blue Gloves’ A standard achieved by continuous sanitization and use of disposables.</p>
<p>Nothing is more important on a Sakasti premise than adhering to the ‘Blue Gloves’ standard of hygiene. We work by it. We live by it.</p>
