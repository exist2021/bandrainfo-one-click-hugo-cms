<p>At The Elbo Room the vintage pub aesthetic is given a sophisticated twist and often one thinks it strongly resembles a traditional Irish or British pub; the walls are embellished with prints of French &amp; Italian poser art by the likes of Henry Le Monnier and Lenonetto Cappielllo. The music is a mixture of retro, rock &amp; jazz. The music is loud enough to enjoy and soft enough to enjoy a conversation!</p>

<p>The Elbo Room has mahogany interiors with use of a lot of wood, giving a very relaxed and chilled out feel to the place, making everyone feel at ease at once. The tall stools around the bar depict the owners’ love for the Queen’s City. Hence the name Elbo Room – your elbows are sometimes on your high table or sometimes touching someone else’s. The Elbo Room is a place where you can completely relax and ‘let your hair down’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The staff is very friendly &amp; attentive and in no time will have you trying some of the specialities on the menu – perhaps from the 7 Sins Cocktails – Lust, Envy, Greed, Wrath, Sloth, Vanity &amp; Gluttony or perhaps a variation from ‘Elbo’s Cocktails’ which consists of 4 different types of Long Island Ice Teas, for example the Cosmo LIT, which uses cranberry juice instead of cola with vodka, white rum, gin, tequila, brandy &amp; triple sec. For the wine lovers – there is a great selection of imported wines as well as signature sangria &amp; wine cocktails by Turning Point.</p>

<p>The food includes The Elbo Room’s signature dishes such as the Italian Mix – Pizzas, Pasta &amp; Panini, along with fresh salads, BBQ and Tandoor. Chef Nirmal has also added more varieties in the appetizers since that is what people prefer to dig into whilst in a Pub! The new appetizers in The Elbo Room includes: Crispy Thread Paneer, Spinach with Almond Flakes, Lebanese Sharwma, Shumai, Cutlet &amp; Chips, Chicken Basil Chilly, Honey Smoked Chicken, Korean Lamb Chilly &amp; Steamed King Prawns. For those who would prefer a complete meal there is the Chef’s Specials – Sizzlers – all served in a range of sauces with French fries, Sauté Veg &amp; Herbed Rice.</p>
