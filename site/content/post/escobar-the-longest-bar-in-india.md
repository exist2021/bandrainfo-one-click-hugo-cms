<p><strong>ESCOBAR</strong> &#8211; is based on the radically new idea of creating a high-end &amp; chic atmosphere that would combine a restaurant and bar and was launched in 2010 january as the jewel in the Bandra&#8217;s crown. It rapidly became the coolest hot spots of the Mumbai night scene. A brilliant success due in large part to the restaurants’ enchanting and totally unique settings, an inspired and high-quality cuisine, attentive service and a skillfully distilled musical ambiance tailored to each area of the venue.</p>
<p>Dining at Escobar means removing yourself from the frenzy of urban life and plunging into a rejuvenating bath.</p>
