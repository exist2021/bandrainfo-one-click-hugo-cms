<p>So It&#8217;s kind of surprising why Lemon Leaf could not survive Bandra rents, and a CCD would survive. I mean a Coffeeshop would have less revenue than a full-fledged restaurant like lemon leaf right? Lemon Leaf I believe has set up shop in Colaba and only does a takeaway food from its kitchen in Bandra.</p>
<p>But change is constant, in that corner we have now Krispy Kreme, CCD and the XVII Tea room close.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures from the new CCD.</p>
