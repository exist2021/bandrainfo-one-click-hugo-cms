From here began the saga of the deliciously flavored saffron colored rice cooked with meats: The Biryani.</p>
<p>Biryani originates from the Persian word ‘Biryan” meaning fried actually implying pressure fried.</p>
<p>And if it is Biryani, it’s Lucky.</p>
<p>Lucky is situated at a busy crossroad (corner of three lamps as it was known in the olden days) of suburban Bandra, Mumbai. Lucky’s Biryani has become quite a household name since its inception way back on Friday 9th September 1938 started by Sayed Ali Akbarul Huseini. This restaurant is jointly being looked after his sons and grandchildren, who have been groomed in the family traditions.</p>
