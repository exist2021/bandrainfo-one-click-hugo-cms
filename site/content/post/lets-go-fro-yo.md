<p style="text-align: left;">Our unique range of smoothies are made fresh and include the low fat frozen yogurt. Our smoothies are combinations of fresh fruits, juices, premium gourmet syrups, fruit purees and honey, making them healthy, refresing and including all essential vitamins and proteins required as part of a balanced daily diet. Fro Yo special refreshers make them one of a kind. They are sprite based combinations and are finally topped with frozen yogurt which can be enjoyed at first and then mixed into the drink.</p>
