<p>Vista is an all-day contemporary cafe that offers the perfect ambience for a quick breakfast, business lunch or an intimate evening meal. It serves Western, Indian and Oriental cuisine, but the highlight of Vista is the island kitchen and the sweeping ocean view.</p>
<p>Freshness is the underlying theme at Vista, from authentic and fresh Italian hand tossed pizzas baked in special wood fired oven to freshly baked croissants and muffins at breakfast. Special care has been taken to cater to the vegetarian and health conscious guests. A variety of cocktails, an exhaustive wine list and freshly brewed choice of coffees and teas completes the beverage repertoire.</p>
<p>Overlooking the lobby of the hotel, Vista offers a joyful atmosphere. Golden sand marble flooring is complimented by a soft grey flurry stone used on tables and countertops. Slatted Indian mahogany screening adds richness of colour and assists in delineating spaces throughout the restaurant. Handsome fabrics serve to unify the marble and timbers. Smokey grey leather compliments the grey flurry marble. Western red cedar Venetian blinds screen the windows that overlook the sea lending a resort feel to an otherwise urban city meeting place. A freshness of colour and refined lines create a perfect backdrop for the renowned Taj hospitality.</p>
