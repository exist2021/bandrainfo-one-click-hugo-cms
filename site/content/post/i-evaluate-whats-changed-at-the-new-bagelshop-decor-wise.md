<p>Bagelshop is one of the homegrown coffee shops in Bandra, frequented by a very loyal expat crowd and besides its rustic setting, you would catch here anybody from Mumbai&#8217;s celebrity circuit.</p>
<p>Bagelshop completed ten years, and I guess it was getting a bit dated and this was a perfect time, to renovate and redecorate. The newly done up place looks chic with beautiful corner tables, fixed furniture and some high tables too. You could almost mistake it for a lounge bar.</p>
<p>The place looks bright and shiny and I feel might accommodate even more people now. I loved the community table addon. Check out the video about for more information on the new look.</p>
