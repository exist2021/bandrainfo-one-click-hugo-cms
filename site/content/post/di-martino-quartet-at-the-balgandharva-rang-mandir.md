<p>International jazz with the John DI Martino Quartet will be played at the Balgandharva Rang Mandir in Bandra on November 27.</p>
<h2><strong>JOHN DI MARTINO JAZZ QUARTET FEATURING WARREN VACHE </strong></h2>
<p>John DI Martino is no stranger to India. He played in the band of Houston Person at the Jus Jazz Festival 2012 and also in 2013 with his own group. On both occasions he was appreciated by Indian jazz aficionados.</p>
<p>He is a jazz pianist in the classic mould and is much in demand as the leader of his rhythm section with several soloists.</p>
<p>Warren Vache, who plays Trumpet, cornet and flugelhorn is quite special. He is credited with leading the revival of hardbop and swing after the decade of the 70s dominated by fusion and experimenting with the electronic sounds in jazz. Vache and later, Wynton Marsalis were instrumental in bringing back the mainstream sound into jazz.</p>
<p>Warren Vache made several popular recordings with saxophonist Scott Hamilton and will be coming to India for the first time.</p>
<p>This quartet is expected to play an evening of melody and swing.</p>
