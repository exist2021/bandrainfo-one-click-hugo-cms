<p style="color: #222222;">Glamour, ethnicity, creativity and luxury all come together under one roof at this store on Turner Road, Bandra. Tucked away among the luxury jewellery stores lining this street is this gorgeous gem of a store by Interior Designer Kavita Singh and daughter Nandini, both prominent collectors of Indian art with a strong background in interior design.</p>

<p style="color: #222222;">Treasure trove<br />
On display at the store is furniture designed by Kavita herself, as well as special items that have been sourced individually by both partners. The highlight of the store is its art, which includes, among others, Pichwais, Kalighat paintings and art works by Uma Kilachand. It also includes some stunning photographs and objects d´art in silver and bronze.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Another highlight of the product range is the furniture and accessories from Thailand-based Lotus Arts de Vivre. Venetian mirror frames and a collection of crystal chandeliers and lights bring the European touch. Some old pieces of furniture have been given a contemporary twist, such as an old cabinet reinvented into a contemporary bar, or the bronze masks that are given a modern setting by the well-designed acrylic bases they are positioned on.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The store´s style is eclectic and bold, yet restrained by careful editing which can only come from years of experience and the drive for continuous evolution. Discerning designers, this one is definitely worth a visit.</p>
