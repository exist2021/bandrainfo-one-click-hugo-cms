<p><strong> </strong><strong><u>SPECIALIZED SERVICES</u></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Cosmetic Dentistry</em></strong><strong><em> &amp; Smile Makeovers</em></strong><em><br />
</em>Cosmetic dentistry is dentistry aimed at creating a positive change to your teeth and to your smile. Most think of tooth whitening or veneers when cosmetic dentistry comes to mind, but Smile Essentials can provide much more.</p>
<p><strong>It includes : </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bleaching to make teeth whiter</li>
<li>Repairing chips or rough spots with fillings that match your teeth</li>
<li>Filling cavities with tooth-colored materials</li>
<li>Reshaping teeth that don&#8217;t match the others</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Dental Implants</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>When should you consider oral implants at Smile Essentials? </em></strong></p>
<p>Anyone who has missing one or more of their teeth due to injury, disease or decay maybe a candidate for Dental Implants. So When You</p>
<ul>
<li>Want the most effective way of restoring your chewing function and superior aesthetic results with your tooth   replacement.</li>
<li>Repairing chips or rough spots with fillings that match your teeth</li>
<li>Do not want to have your natural teeth cut down, which is required in making a conventional dental bridge.</li>
<li>Cannot tolerate, wear or chew well with your dentures.</li>
<li>Have lost your back teeth making it impossible to construct a conventional dental bridge.</li>
<li>Have a long toothless span which is not indicated for making a dental bridge.</li>
<li>Because of periodontal disease your adjacent teeth are too weak to take the load of a conventional dental bridge.…You can consider oral implants.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Laser Dentistry</em></strong></p>
<p>Periodontal (gum) diseases, including gingivitis and periodontitis are serious infections, that if left untreated can lead to tooth loss. Treatment of gum disease is aimed at cleaning the debris and toxins from beneath your gum line. This can now be accomplished virtuously painlessly and comfortably depending on the stage of your disease, using lasers. Laser light removes bacteria and diseased tissue from the pockets. The laser prepares the root surface to enable healthy gum attachment and aids in sealing the pocket closed. When lasers are used during periodontal therapy, there is less bleeding, swelling and discomfort to the patient.</p>
<ul>
<li>Treatment for Gummy Smiles</li>
<li>Treatment for Dark Gums</li>
<li>Teeth Whitening / Bleaching</li>
<li>Biopsy/ Lesion Removal• Root Canals</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Orthodontics</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Why you should get orthodontic treatment?</em></strong><em><br />
</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of orthodontic treatment is a beautiful smile and a good bite—meaning straight teeth that mesh well with the teeth in the opposite jaw and look great.</li>
<li>A good bite makes it easier for you to bite, chew and speak.</li>
<li>A beautiful smile adds to self-esteem, self-confidence and leads toward career advancement.</li>
<li>We live in a competitive world and a great smile can give you the edge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Pediatric dentistry</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>When should the parent get the child to the dentist for a first check up?</em></strong><em><br />
</em><br />
When the child is about two and a half years of age, it is recommended that they visit a pediatric dentist.Any problems in these baby teeth including tooth decay, malformation and other dental health problems can be identified and resolved immediately.</p>
<p>Children have baby teeth before they shift to the permanent teeth. These baby teeth are also prone to tooth decay and all kinds of dental issues. This period lasting three to six months is important, as this is the time in which kids begin to develop their milk teeth. Ideally they should learn about caries, methods for caries detection and prevention, the proper way to brush teeth, and how to maintain all round dental health and well being.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>TESTIMONIALS </u></em></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Alain Zayan Director of Alliance Francaise</strong></p>
<p>I was very pleased by the re activity of the team\. I broke my tooth just a few hours before departing for a week long meeting in Delhi. The doctors attended to me immediately and in an hour I had a temporary tooth. The job was completed the other week with great effectiveness and always with the same warm smile. Definitely recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Pratik Murarka (Owner Idea Labs)</strong></p>
<p>In my life I have interacted with numerous doctors across various fields of medicine and usually they project to mask the humdrum of it being &#8220;Just another day at the job&#8221;.</p>
<p>With her awesome high tech gadget filled clinic is possibly what got in the dentist chair and her brilliant handwork and very real compassion that kept me in the chair. Smile Essentials is the next level of evolution- a gifted doctor using cutting edge technology to assist you and most importantly who treats you as a person and not &#8220;just another day at work&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Dolly Parasher, Shweta &amp; Co., Modeling Agency, NY, USA</strong></p>
<p>I came in to her clinic on my visit to India from NYC. Her professionalism, personal attention and extremely clean office blew me away. She and her Staff are pleasant, interactive and extremely good at work they do.</p>
<p>Dr Diksha got to know me and my lifestyle and understand what work I wanted and why and that high touch. I have been to other celebrity dentist but Dr Diksha has proved to be up to par in providing stellar service. Watch out Mumbai, I know they will make a huge mark and will leave everyone smiling</p>
<p><strong>Tasneem Jetpurwala, Owner Galaxy Optician</strong></p>
<p>I recommeded my 2 year old niece living in Dubai who was facing issues due to tooth decay My sister in law delayed the treatment due to the fear of how her little one will bear the pain . She spoke to Dr Diksha on the phone and all her queries were well addressed and she was comfortable to proceed with the treatment. The most striking part was that the whole clinic was dancing to the tunes of Party with the Bhootnath Returns son, which was Insiyas favourite song and was played to keep her engaged. I highly recommend Dr Diksha for Painless and Homely dental care</p>
<p>They are a true example of putting the care in dental care.</p>
<p><strong>Kajal Samwani, Owner of Venus Design</strong></p>
<p>Her staff is like an extended family to me and I have always received care above and beyond the norm and her dental practice is a true model of what dental care should be like.</p>
<p>After the procedure she even makes follow up calls and messages in the evening to make sure everything is alright.</p>
<p><strong>Aruna Balkrishna Singh ,The Content Company, MD &amp; CEO </strong></p>
<p>I am extremely phobic about dental care and dentist. Initially I did not show up for 3 appointments but she patiently followed up and rescheduled my appointments.</p>
<p>I was surprised at the efficiency and skill employed and not one was there any pain or mild discomfort.</p>
<p>Thank you Dr Diksha for making a truly painful phobia turn into a pleasure and even a comfort. You are an asset to you profession and I honestly respect your skill and patience, especially when dealing with someone as difficult as me</p>
<p><strong>Aura Denmark</strong></p>
<p>My visit at Smile Essentials was perfect! Everyone were super lined and treated you as a guest. I was well informed about the procedure and always knew what is going to happen next.</p>
<p>The atmosphere is amazing, clean and fresh. Strongly recommend it to all. 5 Stars.</p></blockquote>
