<p dir="auto">One of the most pertinent problems to solve is to find a good unlimited internet connection. 4G services like Jio have taken a bit of the pain out of our lives. However it would be too risky to rely completely on one service provider. If you like to stream content, nothing but unlimited plans works for you. In this case, the neighbourhood broadband ISP is immensely valuable.</p>
<p>Here I am compiling a list of the broadband service in Bandra/khar. I have used about three of them and have written my take on them, for the rest I have tried to google reviews. The best option is to talk to your friends and neighbours, but for others this list would be useful.</p>
<p>Check out the results of the <a href="httpss://exist2016.typeform.com/report/vJrpyf/T9GF">Survey</a> I did to find out which is the best ISP for bandra/Khar. Also you can register your <a href="httpss://exist2016.typeform.com/to/vJrpyf">vote here</a>.</p>

<strong>Qucik review</strong><br />
When I shifted to Khar I used to live next to the Khar telephone exchange. This was way back in 2012 and 2014. MTNL when it worked it worked well, otherwise it was a pain. I had to walk down to the MTNL office next door to get things sorted.</p>

<h2>WINCABLE</h2>
<p>Quick Review<br />
When I moved to Bandra, I called on Brain Cable and Wincable. Wincable thrilled me by installing the same day, elated and euphoric I blogged about them. But As I mentioned, their plans were expensive and I had to cop out in favour of Joister.</p>
<p>The service with Wincable is flaky. Nothing goes wrong most of the time, but somehow you don&#8217;t feel confident on the service front.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Quick Review</strong> &#8211;<br />
I met my neighbour when I was unhappy with Wincable. My neighbour recommend that I should shift to Joister. He said he is on an unlimited plan and downloads a lot of stuff. So I got on to Joister I find Joister pretty incredible. I had only one issue and that was also resolved in 24 hours,The plans are the best and unlimited.<br />

<h2>Hathaway</h2>

<p><strong>Quick Opinion</strong><br />
There is a lady on twitter, from Pali Hill and is always outraging about disruption in her connection. Our survey results have put Hathway Broadband in the 3rd place. May be the number of users in Bandra/Khar for Hathway is higher, hence more the number of complaints? However I would advise you to exercise discretion before settling for Hathway.</p>

<h2>Brian Cable</h2>
<p><strong>Quick Opinion</strong></p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t find any significant information on Brian Internet. It seems to be a local operator who has leased bandwith from some major player. Old time bandra-ites patronise Brian and they seem pretty happy about the speeds.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Quick Opinion</strong><br />
Airtel Broadband doesn&#8217;t have a big base in bandra, but it does provide services in some areas of Bandra. I have heard they have FUP limits in their plan and unlimited might be a bit expensive.</p>
