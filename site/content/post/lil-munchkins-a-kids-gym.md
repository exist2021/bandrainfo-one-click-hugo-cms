The kid’s gym program helps to increase motor and balance skills, build confidence, develop body awareness and space orientation. All the activities are carried out in a group encouraging social interaction while the children develop &amp; play together. It includes large tumbling mats, slides, stairs, ropes and much more! There is plenty of room to jump, run, roll, crawl in a safe fun environment. It’s a fun place for kids.</p>
<p>For every stage of your child’s life – from 10 months to age 10 – there’s a program filled with movement, music, learning, cooperation and fun. Each age-appropriate curriculum builds upon the next. Children progress at their own pace, developing their confidence as they develop their skills.</p>
<p>Seven reasons why and how children benefit from a kids gym</p>
<p>1. Increases muscle strength and promotes healthy bones</p>
<p>2. Enhances flexibility</p>
<p>3. Improves cognition</p>
<p>4. Reduces risky behaviors and faulty posture or poor biomechanics</p>
<p>5. Develops good neural growth</p>
<p>6. Fosters confidence encouraging better social skills</p>
<p>7. And, its fun !</p>
<p>The five pillars of Lil’ Munchkins are strength, balance, movement, stability and flexibility. Our aim is to have healthy kids, healthy families, healthy communities.</p>
<p>Kids at Lil&#8217; Munchkins learn to be stronger in body (motor skills, strength and coordination), mind (creativity, cognitive development and problem solving) and spirit (social development and confidence).</p>
<p>Lil’ Munchkins also teaches basic gymnastics to children ages walking to fifteen with high functioning disabilities such as: (autism, aspergers syndrome, ADD/ADHD, down syndrome and hearing impairements). Most children enjoy playing actively, and exercising in a group can be especially enjoyable for kids with developmental delays or other special needs.</p>
<p>Lil&#8217; Munchkins can positively affect the lives of both you and your child.</p>
