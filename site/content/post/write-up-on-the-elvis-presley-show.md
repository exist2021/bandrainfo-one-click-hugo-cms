<p dir="auto">Elvis Presley, the iconic musical giant lives on even decades after his demise. His music appealed to people across generations and that is the secret of his magic.&nbsp;<br />Now Raell Padamsee’s Ace Productions presents ‘Elvis – Long Live The King’ at Bandra’s St. Andrews auditorium on Sunday August 5th. The very talented Siddharth Meghani, who has been doing Elvis covers for years now, will be helming this Elvis Presley Tribute show. Siddharth Meghani has been performing songs by Elvis Presley since the tender age of 10. “Elvis has always been a big part of my life. While I listened to The Beatles and other music, I outgrew everything else but Elvis stayed with me,&#8221; Meghani recalls, adding that he has had Elvis-like sideburns ever since he started growing facial hair!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ace Productions had an earlier show in mid July at the Tata Theatre, which was completely sold out and was a smashing hit! The audiences’ response was amazing! They were grooving,singing and reliving every Elvis hit song. This is exactly what will happen at the performance at Andrews next Sunday. We can look forward to our very own Siddharth Meghani presenting the total Elvis package &#8211; the look, the sound, the charisma, together with his superb Live Band. This show takes the audience across a journey in the life of Elvis with the help of stunning visuals on Led Screens, backing vocalists and glitzy Rhinestone costumes that have a truly authentic Las Vegas experience. The Elvis Presley magic will have the audience grooving and dancing in the aisles. We can look forward to an engaging and uplifting Elvis experience, which is not just a show but a celebration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get all set to groove and move to Elvis&#8217;s&#8217; greatest hits – Jailhouse Rock, Hound Dog, Love me tender and many more. Having seen his fair share of Elvis impersonators, Rollingstone’s jazz music critic Sunil Sampat, told DNA in an interview, that he regards Meghani as &#8220;the most genuine one&#8221;. Elvis &#8211; Long Live the King! is definitely a show for the entire family! Get “All Shook Up” with a tribute show to the king of Rock n Roll &#8211; Elvis Presley!&nbsp;</p>
