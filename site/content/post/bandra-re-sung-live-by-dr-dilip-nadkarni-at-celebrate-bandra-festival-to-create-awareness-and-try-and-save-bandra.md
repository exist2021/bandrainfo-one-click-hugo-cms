The 2011 edition of the action-packed festival saw over 100 events from November 12 to November 27, 2011.</p>
<p>The festival contributes towards a better quality of life for Bandra residents. In the past, the festival has sponsored a rainwater harvesting project, a solar water heating project, school buses for an orphanage and a school for underprivileged children. It also donated a bus to the Kripa Foundation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It all began when several individuals and organizations realized how rich and textured Bandra life was, and how worthy it was of salutation. And that is why in November 2003, all of Bandra came together in a unique celebration of culture, colour, vibrancy and entertainment. Spearheaded by several Residents’ Associations like the Bandra West Residents Association, Bandra Bandstand Residents Trust, Federation of H/W Ward Citizens Trust and Bandra Reclamation Area Volunteers Organization along with Fountainhead Promotions and Events Pvt. Ltd., Celebrate Bandra 2003 serves as a model example of the suburb’s many talents and inherent cultural harmony. Since inception in 2003, each festival has been theme based, for example, in 2005 – Education, 2007 – Heritage, 2009 – Environment and 2011 – Diversity.</p>
