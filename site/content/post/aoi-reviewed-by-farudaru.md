I just had to try out this place after all the rave reviews. And I have to say it sure lived up to everything they said.This place actually replaced another restaurant I quite loved, but I&#8217;m not complaining because Aoi is better than the other one. Anyway, lets get back to the topic.</p>
<p>You may actually miss this tiny place if you don&#8217;t keep an eye out for it, so you better do. I love the way the huge windows let natural light just flood this tiny and cozy 30-seater restaurant. The cute origami bird lights hanging from the ceiling make the place look soo gorgeous. I want them in my room!!! And the manga art on the walls give the place a lovely Japanese-y feeling.</p>
<p>Seating is comfortable, service is very attentive, friendly and the best part is, the waiters actually know the menu well, so they also do good recommendations. +1 for that.</p>
<p>The bento box concept is quite awesome! You get sushi, rice, chicken, soup and more in a neat box with sections. How cool is that! The salmon sushi was yummy.</p>
<p>You must try the tenderloin steak here, it&#8217;s flavors are very unique. Also, Don&#8217;t leave without trying the Aoi Breezer it&#8217;s delicious.</p>
<p>My only complaint, yes, I know that wasabi is supposed to be had &#8216;just a little bit&#8217; but giving literally ONE DOT of wasabi between 4 people for 8 pieces of sushi is stupid. We had to call the waiter several times for a refill. Same goes for the wasabi-mayo dip.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t have desserts, so boo! üôÅ Also, an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet will be perfect for a place like this.</p>
<p>So here you go&#8230; THE MUST HAVES:</p>
<p>1) Classic Miso Soup</p>
<p>2) Chicken kara Age with Mayo-wasabi dip</p>
<p>3) Teriyaki chicken Bento</p>
<p>4) Aoi Breezer to wash it all down</p>
<p>I have to go back soon for the Ramen and Teas.</p>
<p>Happy Eating! üôÇ</p>
