<p>Wow! This is the most beautiful sketch of Bandra Station from WR archives. Would love to know more about this sketch, when was it done and what year was it done? <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-8014 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CAht9-eUQAAXbzS.jpg?resize=599%2C337&#038;ssl=1" alt="CAht9-eUQAAXbzS" width="599" height="337" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CAht9-eUQAAXbzS.jpg?w=599&amp;ssl=1 599w, https://i1.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CAht9-eUQAAXbzS.jpg?resize=500%2C281&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
