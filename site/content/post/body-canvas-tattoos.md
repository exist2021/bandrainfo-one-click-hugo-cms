<p class="style1">Body canvas comprises of ‘ Body Canvas Tattoos &amp; Piercings ’ and ‘ Body Canvas Academy ’</p>
<p>‘Body Canvas Tattoos &amp; Piercings’ today is one of the biggest and leading tattoo parlours and piercing studios in Mumbai. It was started in Mumbai with the vision of being recognized as a successful, growing, ethical provider of quality and creative tattoos in a safe, hygienic and sterile environment.</p>
<p>Having been in the tattoos industry since 1998, ‘Body Canvas Tattoos &amp; Piercings’ offers you a team of experienced and highly skilled foreign trained tattoo artists who have over the years mastered different types of tattoo art styles ranging from old school and tribal tattoos to biomechanical tattoos: from abstract tattoos to realistic and fantasy tattoos.</p>
<p>The tattoo machines we use are high quality tattoo machines imported from UK, USA &amp; Germany. The needles are imported from UK and USA. These are disposable sterilized (EO Gas) needles for 1 time use only. We only use non-toxic, pure organic pigments (water or oil based) which are 100% safe on the human skin with no known side-effects. These are handpicked and personally bought by us from Europe and UK to ensure authenticity and best quality.</p>
