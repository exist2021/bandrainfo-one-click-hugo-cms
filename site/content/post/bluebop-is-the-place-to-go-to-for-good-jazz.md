<p>The newly opened <a   href="https://www.facebook.com/bluebopcafe/">Bluebop Cafe </a>on Linking Road in Khar West offers an immersive hospitality experience with an artisanal Italian American cuisine, delectable cocktails and a performance space for live jazz music, as they always have live jazz sessions on the weekends.</p>
<p>The night we were there, there was a brilliant performance by the inimitable Sonia Saigal on vocals, and she was accompanied by Harmeet on the keyboards. He is really quite outstanding. They were ably supported by other musicians on bass and drums.</p>
<p>The cozy, intimate space at the BlueBop cafe, is divided between two seating areas – one that’s closer to the stage setup, and one that is at a little distance from it, so of course we sat as close to the musicians as possible! The interiors aim to achieve a warm environment that is classy, comfortable and not intimidating, so that one can actually sit down and enjoy a good meal and listen to great music simultaneously.</p>
<p>Spearheading the culinary affair at The Bluebop Cafe is the young and talented<strong> Chef Saurabh Raturi who</strong> has conceptualised the menu and he has been inspired by the jazz cafes in New York. The cocktails have been concocted by mixologist  <strong>Dinesh Mondka</strong>r.</p>

<p>Their Italian American menu is an interesting spread and has a host of vegan and gluten-free options. The must-tries are the seafood bisque, the Mozzarella balloon Salad and the freshly prepared Barley and Millet salad. The delectable appetisers like Jerk Chicken Tacos, Asparagus and Polenta with a piquant garlic flavour, and the Crispy Calamari Crocanti go perfectly with the bar menu. However, their baked New York Style Pizzas like Pepperoni and Cinque Formaggio seem to be very popular, while their main course like Mushroom Risotto and the Grilled Norwegian Salmon also have many takers. The desserts have some delicious options as well. Their Tiramisu and Profiteroles are particularly light and delectable.</p>

<p>The bar menu boasts of quirky cocktails like the Espresso Martini, Go Bananas, which is prepared with sous-vide whiskey and banana with a hint of caramel and orange bitters. The Hibiscus Gimlet made with an in-house prepared hibiscus cordial and Gin is another popular choice.</p>
<p>If you’re a jazz lover, you will enjoy the gigs hosted every Friday and Saturday. But even if you’re not, The Bluebop Cafe is an all-day cafe and should be on your must-visit list for its memorable food and a great vibe. It is a super place for hanging out with friends at lunch or dinner time, and just perfect for Kitty party lunches as well, because their food and ambience are both fabulous! Do make it a point to go there.</p>
