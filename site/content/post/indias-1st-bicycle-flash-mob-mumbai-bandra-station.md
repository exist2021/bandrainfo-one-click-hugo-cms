<p>For the first time in India, a Bicycle Flash Mob to mark &#8216;Intl Cycle &#8211; To &#8211; Work Day&#8217; was conceptualised by Cyc Firoza and executed along with Anil Uchil on May 19, 2012. The performance of 70 avid cyclists has been recognised by LIMCA BOOK OF RECORDS as a NATIONAL RECORD title for India&#8217;s first bicycle flash mob. It was choreographed by Dev Kakkad to the tunes of &#8216;Yahaan Ke Hum Sikander&#8217; from the movie &#8216;Jo Jeeta Woh Sikander&#8217;. The feat was performed at Bandra Railway Station, Mumbai at the peak arrival time of commuters; the purpose was to get them thinking of &#8216;CYCLING&#8217; as an alternate personal mode of transport.</p>
