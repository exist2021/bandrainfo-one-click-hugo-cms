<p>Alina went on to create her own boutique MALMAL in 2009 in the bustling Linking Road, Bandra. The store houses Alina’s signature home designs as well as other designer’s clothes line, shoes, handbags, jewellery etc.<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/malmal-image-3.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1187 aligncenter" alt="malmal image 3" src="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/malmal-image-3.jpg?resize=598%2C315&#038;ssl=1" width="598" height="315" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/malmal-image-3.jpg?w=598&amp;ssl=1 598w, https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/malmal-image-3.jpg?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Says Alina, “The word MALMAL came around keeping in mind the nature of the fabric – malmal… as we were looking at a wide range of day wear dressing which can be dressed up as evening wear dressing. As for the name, we do a lot of fusion between a western design and style with an Indian print or border. We also do totally western designs in Indian fabric prints.”</p>
<p>Malmal offers a one stop shopping experience to achieve a complete head-to-toe look. Brimming with colour and fantastic design, the Malmal store has something for everyone, especially those who love to be one of a kind. With garments that can be dressed up or dressed down, you can actually feel the evolution from Daywear to Evening wear.</p>
<p>With design at the heart of absolutely everything done, you can expect fabulous new fashion available in store every week. Get to pick from a wide array of ready-to-wear ethnic wear, shoes, bags, jewellery, stoles, and accessories with a funky and contemporary edge.</p>
<p>It has been Malmal’s objective to make for different personalities and not just show-windows garments brought to life through sophisticated and innovative design that keeps fashion in mind while adding a fresh and unique touch.</p>
<p>Fabrics are chosen as per the weather for where the garment is brought. The idea of fusion wears at Malmal was to keep playing with the balance of the fusion itself – to create an unexpected eclectiv look, a customized feel that can never be got off the shelf.<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/malmal-image-6.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1188 aligncenter" alt="malmal image 6" src="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/malmal-image-6.jpg?resize=596%2C340&#038;ssl=1" width="596" height="340" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/malmal-image-6.jpg?w=596&amp;ssl=1 596w, https://i0.wp.com/bandra.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/malmal-image-6.jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
