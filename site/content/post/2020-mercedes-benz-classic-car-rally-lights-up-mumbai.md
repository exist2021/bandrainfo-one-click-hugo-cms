Some of India’s most immaculately maintained Mercedes-Benz models were on display at the seventh edition of the annual **Mercedes-Benz Classic Car Rally (MBCCR)**, which was held this morning at the **Taj Lands End in Bandra**. The MBCCR was conducted with strict adherence to **Covid-19 protocols and regulations.**

The event, which has been organised by **Autocar India since 2014**, saw participation from several prominent faces on the classic car scene. These included **Viveck Goenka** with his Mercedes-Benz Nurburg; **Pratapsinhrao Gaekwad** and his 230SL, and, among others, industrialist **Gautam Singhania** and his 190SL.

This year’s event was themed around **resilience**, and also felicitated **women police officers of Mumbai** who are among the people who have kept Mumbai ticking since March.

**Maharashtra Home Minister Shri Anil Deshmukh, who was the chief guest** at the event, said, “For the last nine to ten months, we have all been fighting back against the pandemic. The Mumbai Police has lost several of its officers and constables, but our brave police officers are not going to give up and the fight will go on as long as it takes. I’m extremely happy to see  events such as these recognising their service to society in this unprecedented time.”

The participating cars drove in a convoy over the Bandra-Worli Sea Link from Taj Lands End to Worli Dairy and back, and the sight of these ‘rolling museums on wheels’ attracted, as always, a lot of attention from onlookers and fellow road-users. **Over 40 cars participated in the rally this year** — entries were limited to conform to Covid-19 regulations —  and these included every generation of the Mercedes-Benz SL, S-Class and E-Class in almost every body style. They were accompanied by, besides the Nurburg, the 230SL and the 190SL, cars from Mercedes’ 170V range.

“It’s a pleasure to see so many ‘car-proud’ participants, men and women who are proud of the heritage and innovation of Mercedes-Benz cars and have taken great pains to keep their cars immaculately maintained,” said Santosh Iyer, vice-president, sales & marketing, Mercedes-Benz India. “At the same time, we at Mercedes-Benz have been relentlessly supporting the state and central governments in the fight against Covid-19, and we will continue doing our bit until the fight is over.”

The MBCCR ranks among the most prestigious one-make events of its kind in the world and a consistent participation from Mercedes-Benz owners has put the event on the global classic car enthusiasts’ map.

“This year’s MBCCR event is a special one. This ‘rally for resilience’, emerging from a truly trying year, is best represented by these classic Mercedes-Benz cars that have remained resilient against the test of time.” said rally curator and Autocar India classic car expert Perseus Bandrawalla.
