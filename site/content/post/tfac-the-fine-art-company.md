<p>The Fine Art Company was founded by Geetu Hinduja in 1998 as a gallery space and reinvented itself as a consultancy in 2004. 14 years since its inception, TFAC has always encouraged and supported young and emerging talent and has played a large role in establishing some of the artists in the contemporary art world.</p>
<p>TFAC has also worked closely with museums, corporate houses, hotels and other organizations in advising them on art and helping with art acquisitions and commissions.</p>
<p>In 2012 TFAC reopened as a small gallery and hosted a few art shows exhibiting small works. In 2013 The Fine Art Company is launching a new initiative &#8211; TFAC STUDIO, which will be a project space by the Company operating from Bandra.</p>
<p>It will act as a multidisciplinary and interactive space for artists, curators, film makers, writers, designers, and the likes buzzing with several events, workshops, art shows, talks, seminars, music gigs in its small intimate space.</p>
<p>TFAC STUDIO encourages new and emerging talent and aims to be an incubator in helping all creative individuals generate new ideas giving room to experiment and ponder.</p>
