<p>Most traditional Bengali sweets have memories and sentiments attached to them, be it the Nolen Gurer Rossogolla, Chomchoms, Kheer Kodom and others. These have been created and recreated by many. But what is the real taste of a pure Bengali mishti?</p>
<p>There are a million variations to a simple rossogolla. But only few can boast about creating the perfect Bengali sweet that you can never resist.</p>

<p>Sweet Bengal was started to give Mumbai a taste of actual Bengali sweetmeats. Since the sweets have a limited shelf life, Bengali sweets require the freshest of ingredients and experienced hands to make the perfect Kanchagolla, the varieties of Sondesh, chom choms and Rajbhogs. Karigars specially flown in ensure that the sweetmeats at Sweet Bengal are perfect.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Nothing can lift up your spirits like the snacks being offered here. A higher demand for these snacks prompted addition of the tasty “Koraishutir Kochuri” and “Luchi Alur Dom” to the Sweet Bengal Menu.</span></p>
<p>Spoilt for choice, you can find sweet lovers flocking to Sweet Bengal  including regulars who  have their own favourite choices.</p>
