<p><b>Current Program:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Temperance (Bandra)</b></li>
<li><b>Little-Bo-Peep &#8211;Playschool &amp; Nursery (Khar)</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Annual Yoga Events (Multiple Dimensions):</b></p>
<p><b>BUDDY YOGA</b> helps us draw strength from our union and better enables us to show gratitude for each other. Also opens your body more deeply than you could alone. Offering something unique to partners by fortifying trust, communication and increases one&#8217;s compassion for others. Both partners rely on each other&#8217;s support to keep correct body alignment, balance, and concentration.</p>
<p><b>MANDALA</b> is a Sanskrit word for “Healing Circle”. Mandalas are used in therapies especially for young ones, bringing peacefulness. Mandalas arise from the compelling human need to know our own inner reality, to align this knowing with our body’s wisdom, and to awaken in ourselves a sense of being in harmony with the Universe. Therefore Mandala supports meditating, and is a pure representation of our deepest nature.</p>
<p><b>CIRCUS YOGA</b> brings together the mindfulness of yoga and the playfulness of the circus i.e. blends the consciousness of yoga with the communal celebration of circus. When practiced together it builds self-confidence, focus, trust and teamwork. A rich experience—everyone benefits as the wisdom of age collaborates with the energy of youth. Our non-competitive program offers children a chance to experience fitness through creative expression and group collaboration.</p>
<p><b>CREATIVE ART YOGA</b><b> </b>is a fine way for children to make choices and solve problems. Every step involves making a decision: what color to use, how to make a line, what size to make something. With every choice the object becomes more and more their own. Through creative art experiences, they have opportunities to explore, create and experiment. Using art materials and their unending imaginations, children can express their feelings, demonstrate emerging skills and thoroughly enjoy the process of creating the art itself.</p>
<p><b>SATWIK YOGIC COOKING</b><b> </b>helps<b> </b>children appreciate a wider variety of food as they participate in its preparation. It also encourages creativity, develops their motor skills, builds self confidence and gives them a sense of service.</p>

<p><b>MOTHER CHILD YOGA</b> promotes bonding in a relaxed environment through gentle poses, music and activities and enables the mother to understand her child&#8217;s developmental patterns through the exploration of yoga as well as develop a healthy body, a confident self-awareness and a happy spirit. Eye contact, intentional movement, gentle touch, and the cadence of voice and breath add to the overall experience of yoga with her child. Through the loving care and handling that yoga facilitates, trust is firmly established.</p>
<p><b>NATYA YOGA</b> includes dance which is the primary mode of self expression of any living being. Our classical dances are a great tool not only for self expression but are also a huge science to understand the mind, body and spirit. Through a blend of Theatre exercises and philosophies of Indian Classical Dance the children were taken through a journey of creating awareness of their bodies. Natya Yoga also inculcates a sense of rhythm in the bodies. This awareness of rhythm is added to the awareness of the body and works at multiple levels of the brain and the mind.</p>
<p><b>KRIDA YOGA</b> not only reveal one’s character but also create a field of energy, breaking the barriers of Tamas, converting Rajasic energy into Satvic. Krida (GAMES) will turn into yoga, if we keep constant awareness while playing, which in turn will bring love, harmony, peace &amp; bliss.</p>

<p><b>KIRTANA YOGA</b><b> </b>is a method of using sound for focusing attention &amp; developing aural perceptions as well as expressing emotions. It also helps to develop auditory attention which is very important for later learning’s, especially for learning to read.</p>
<p>Every child has to prepare his/her own religious prayer/ information/poem/ shlok/mantra or anything they wish to.</p>
<p><b>KARMA YOGA</b><b> </b>includes selfless service. This will enable the child to purify their heart. Egoism, hatred, jealousy, selfishness, ideas of superiority and all the kindred negative qualities will vanish. Sense of separateness will be annihilated.</p>
<p><b>Michelangelo’s Leg Writing and Drawing </b>includes using opposite fingers, toes and mouth. This practice aims the child to use both sides of brains. Also underused nerve pathways and connections get activated. This stimulates the growth of new brain cells and brain connections.</p>
<p><b>SHARING AND CARING YOGA</b><b> </b>teaches the children to be kind and gives them opportunities to serve others. It is designed to uphold the principle of equality between all people of the world regardless of religion, caste, colour, creed, age, gender or social status. In addition to the ideals of equality, this tradition expresses the ethics of sharing, community, inclusiveness and oneness of all humankind. [quote]..the Light of God is in all hearts.[/quote]</p>

<p>We thus wish to extend our family by joining your <b>Esteemed Institute</b> and thus nurture the budding kids making <b>Yoga</b> an integral part of their lives.</p>
<p><b>Yoga is no longer viewed as a pastime for the retired. , as Swami Satyananda Saraswati says, ‘Yoga has more to do with the evolution of the human mind and the human body.’ Children hold the key to the future and their evolutionary processes are enhanced by yoga. </b></p>
<p><b>We believe that yoga is a unified system for developing, channelizing and balancing the total personality of a child.  </b></p>
