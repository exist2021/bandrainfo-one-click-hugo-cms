<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Khar station on Mumbai&#8217;s suburban rail network, which became operational on July 1, 1924, as part of Western Railway&#8217;s plan to decongest and serve as an extension of the Bandra suburb, turned 90 on Tuesday.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Thanks to the growing urbanisation and the pressures of a burgeoning population, Khar has today developed an identity of its own.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">The name &#8220;Khar&#8221; took birth from the Marathi word &#8216;khara&#8217;, meaning salty, as most of the nearby area was a marshy land fed by the waters of the Arabian Sea.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Khar-Danda on the western part of Khar is still inhabited by Koli fisherfolk, acknowledged as Mumbai&#8217;s original residents.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Khar was planned to meet the needs of the growing suburban population north of Bandra where the Bombay development departments were carrying out many developmental schemes,&#8221; a Western Railway official said.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Large tracts of wasteland on the western side were reclaimed and converted into residential sites with 842 building plots aimed at a population of around 10,000.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The main hitch was that a new housing scheme was largely dependent on its success for the provision of a convenient railway station. Khar would thus facilitate not just newcomers planning to shift there but also existing residents of the famous Pali Hill and its extensions to get a convenient neighbourhood station,&#8221; the official said.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">The Western Railway had estimated that around 1,700 people would use the Khar station in the then foreseeable future.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Over the years, all calculations went awry, and today Khar is like one of the other bustling mid-junction stations with around 85,000 commuters using the Western Railway suburban network daily.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Though falling in a shadow zone &#8211; as suburban fast trains do not halt here &#8211; Khar retains its importance with as many as 648 Western Railway trains and 108 Harbour Line trains daily.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Its neighbours are Bandra to the south and Santa Cruz to the north.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">By the 1960s, Khar developed into a swanky, posh suburb with many private bungalows, fashionable hotels, restaurants, and later skyscrapers and mega housing complexes, with scores of important schools and colleges coming up in its vicinity.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Today, Khar is home to many Bollywood personalities, industrialists and other celebrities.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Many parts continue to retain their old world charm of a handful of bungalows still visible through shady tree-lined avenues and quiet bylanes.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">As far as commuters and long-distance passengers are concerned, Khar is now an important quick access to the Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, which was conceived a few years ago to decongest the Mumbai Central Terminus.</span></p>
