<p>Bandra has always been a happening place. Even today this Queen of Suburbs, sets an example for the rest of Mumbai as a melting pot of activity and culture, with a large number of restaurants, thriving nightlife and an educational hub. No wonder it attracts a cross-section of people, all wanting to make it their home. Its residents proudly call themselves &#x27;Bandraites&#x27;, a pride that stems from the enormous wealth of culture and talent that exists in this beautiful suburb.</p>
<h2><strong>Celebrate Bandra Festival</strong></h2>
<p>The Celebrate Bandra festival is organised by a Board of Trustees who oversee the core function of all the activities, and who make sure everything is in place to support those who want to be a part of this wonderful community. The Trustees are citizens of Bandra who are passionate about the suburb and are keen on giving back to the community in any way that they can. With hard work and commitment, they have managed to successfully carry out 9 editions of Celebrate Bandra and have stood by each other and the organization since 2003. This mega event is handled by Fountainhead MKTG, a Dentsu Aegis Network. They have created and co-own the Celebrate Bandra festival along with the Celebrate Bandra Trust. With just about a week to go before fun times begin for Bandra folk, there is a lot of entertainment in store for them. From Theatre events, to dance, music and literary events, to sports, heritage walks, and food fests, this special Bandra festival has something for everyone. Make sure you attend.</p>
