The Michelin starred restaurant in Bandra which is known for its modern Cantonese cuisine, has now incorporated more veg dishes including  Hakka Beancurd with Edamame in Toban Sauce (Rs 550),  Stir Fry Chive Flower and Bean Sprouts in Chili Ginger (`395) and Stir Fry Spicy Lotus Root, Celery and Black Fungus (Rs 425). Regulars, do not despair, you can still dig into old favourites like the Crispy Duck Salad (Rs 1,350), something that we swear by for its unique combination of  cress specially flown in from Holland served on a bed of crispy duck tossed in a sauce made with plums.</p>
<p>Also recommended is the newest entrant — the Golden Fried Soft Shell Crab (Rs 995), which combines the Vietnamese Soft Shell Crab (which is golden fried and tossed in a mix of egg threads, curry leaf and bird eye chilli). A crunchy delicious starter that even a non seafood lover enjoyed, when we dropped in for a taste test.</p>
