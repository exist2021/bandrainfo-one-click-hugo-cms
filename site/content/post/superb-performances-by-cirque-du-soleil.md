<p>This show entitled BAZZAR, is the first full production that Cirque du Soleil is performing in India and they have been brought here by Citi Bank and BookMyShow.</p>
<p>This amazing multi-dimensional show pans out under the splendid Big Top which is a miracle in itself. Built by the Cirque du Soleil team, this imposing structure, is the main tent under which the performances take place. The Big Top itself is a wonder that is 19 meters high and 41 meters in diameter and can accommodate 1500 people at once.</p>
<p>Cirque du Soleil’s BAZZAR, has been written and directed by Susan Gaudreau. It is an eclectic mix of infinite creativity where a joyful troupe of acrobats, dancers and musicians craft an awe-inspiring spectacle. Lead by their maestro, who has a monocle painted on one eye, they band together to create vibrant scenes that are full of high-energy and excitement and have the the sounds and colours of a traditional bazaar.</p>
<h2>HIGHLIGHTS FOR Cirque du Soleil’s BAZZAR</h2>
<p>BAZZAR features a range of high voltage acrobatic marvels ranging from teeter board, acrobatic bike contortion, duo roller skating, duo trapeze acts, aerial rope acts, and live music with one singer and two musicians on stage. The music is composed by Simon Carpentier and it really enhances the show. There is so much happening on the stage all the time, that sometimes one does not know where to look! The jumps on the see saw like teeter board, by three of the troupe members, are quite death defying as are the aerial stunts by the duo trapeze artists. The act featuring the age old ‘Indian rope trick’ is really quite incredible and literally requires a “ willing suspension of disbelief” from the audience! The roller skate and acrobatic bicycle acts require an incredible amount of precision and these are all performed to perfection. The tight rope act is an absolutely mesmerising one, and has the audience totally hooked as they watch the jaw dropping somersaults and twists and turns being performed high above on a tight rope, by a Blondin like artist!</p>

<p>The fire dance is very dramatic and so is the Mallakhamb performance by two Indian artists who are also part of the troupe. Mallakhamb is an Indian art form in which aerial yoga and gymnastics are performed on a vertical stationary pole. The finale of this brilliant ninety minutes show is simply superb and has multiple acts being performed simultaneously on stage, and each act is better than the other! The acrobat who twirled numerous golden hoops, an aerial act where a gymnast was suspended just by her hair while performing some fantastic spins in the air, plus other artists who danced some amazing hip hop dancing, had the audience spellbound! This finale had all the wonderful energy and excitement of a real live bazaar, which is how this show BAZZAR, got its name. The costumes by James Lavoie are colourful and exciting and Simon Guilbault’s set design is truly unique.</p>
