<p>One by one, we all know, the beautiful bungalows will disappear, I wonder how many heritage bungalows are still remaining. Godiwala Bungalow was listed on the heritage list and was mysteriously taken out of the list. This is a nicely shot video of Godiwala Bungalow in 1999, unfortunately seems the bungalow wasÂ demolished in 2002.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Acclaimed Film Director Bimal Roy lived here before he passed away in 1966, his family though continued to stay at the place and subsequently were sent notices by Godiwala&#8217;s to give possession of the same. </p>
