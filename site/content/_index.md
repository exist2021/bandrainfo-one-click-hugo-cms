blurb:
  text: Research has also pointed out that if your neighbour says hi to you it
    plays a major role in reducing loneliness!
  heading: Loneliness is an Epidemic
intro:
  text: "As we have more to an increasingly globalised world, we find more common
    with someone who lives abroad but we fail to find connection with people
    around us. This has made us slaves of our phones, constantly craving for
    attention from people who are helpless to be with us. "

values:
  text: We believe a lively culture will have transformative gifts as a general
    feature – it will have groups like AA which address specific problems, it
    will have methods of passing knowledge from old to young, it will have
    spiritual teachings available at all levels of maturation and for the birth
    of the spiritual self. And it will have artists whose creations are gifts
    for the transformation of the race. - The Gift by Lewis Hyde
