  heading: Our values
  text: We believe a lively culture will have transformative gifts as a general
    feature – it will have groups that address specific problems, it will have
    methods of passing knowledge from old to young, it will have spiritual
    teachings available at all levels of maturation and for the birth of the
    spiritual self. And it will have artists whose creations are gifts for the
    transformation of the race. - The Gift by Lewis Hyde
