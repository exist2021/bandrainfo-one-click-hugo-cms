  heading: Our values
  text: We believe a lively culture will have transformative gifts as a general
    feature â€“ it will have groups like AA which address specific problems, it
    will have methods of passing knowledge from old to young, it will have
    spiritual teachings available at all levels of maturation and for the birth
    of the spiritual self. And it will have artists whose creations are gifts
    for the transformation of the race. - The Gift by Lewis Hyde
