blurb:
  heading: Our Mission?
  text: "Bandra info wants to connect you to your neighbours. We think that due to
    globalisation and social media, there has been an epidemic of loneliness
    that has been leashed and the only way to reclaim your life back is to get
    to know your neighbours. "
intro:
  heading: "A Neighbourly Hi! "
  text: 'It is proven that just a simple neighbourly "Hi" can reduce the harmful
    effects of loneliness and it is the most potent way to curb the isolating
    effects of social media. '

values:
  heading: Our values
  text: We believe a lively culture will have transformative gifts as a general
    feature â€“ it will have groups like AA which address specific problems, it
    will have methods of passing knowledge from old to young, it will have
    spiritual teachings available at all levels of maturation and for the birth
    of the spiritual self. And it will have artists whose creations are gifts
    for the transformation of the race. - The Gift by Lewis Hyde
